<p class="fsz7 padtopb">“Two things are to be considered in writing
history, truth and elocution, for in truth consisteth the soul, and
in elocution the body of history; the latter without the former,
is but a picture of history; the former without the latter, unapt
to instruct. The principle and proper work of history, being to

The greater part of the magnificent countries east of the Alleghanies
is in a high state of cultivation and commercial prosperity, with
natural advantages not surpassed in any country. Nature, however, still
maintains her sway in some parts, especially where pine-barrens and
swamps prevail. The territory of the United States covers an area of
2,963,666 square miles, about one-half of which is capable of producing
everything that is useful to man, but not more than a twenty-sixth
part of it has been cleared. The climate is generally healthy, the
soil fertile, abounding in mineral treasures, and it possesses every
advantage from navigable rivers and excellent harbors

<p>The subscriber announces to the public, that he intends publishing
a series of works, relating to the history, literature, biography,
antiquities and curiosities of the Continent of America. To be
entitled</p>

<div class="fsz4">GOWANS’ BIBLIOTHECA AMERICANA.</div>

<p>The books to form this collection, will chiefly consist of reprints
from old and scarce works, difficult to be produced in this
country, and often also of very rare occurrence in Europe; occasionally
an original work will be introduced into the series, designed
to throw light upon some obscure point of American
history, or to elucidate the biography of some of the distinguished
men of our land. Faithful reprints of every work
published will be given to the public; nothing will be added,
except in the way of notes, or introduction, which will be presented
entirely distinct from the body of the work. They will
be brought out in the best style, both as to type, press work and
paper, and in such a manner as to make them well worthy a place
in any gentleman’s library.</p>

<p>A part will appear about once in every six months, or oftener,
if the public taste demand it; each part forming an entire work,
either an original production, or a reprint of some valuable, and
at the same time scarce tract. From eight or twelve parts will
form a handsome octavo volume, which the publisher is well
assured, will be esteemed entitled to a high rank in every collection
of American history and literature.</p>

<p>Should reasonable encouragement be given, the whole collection
may in the course of no long period of time become not less
voluminous, and quite as valuable to the student in American
history, as the celebrated Harleian Miscellany is now to the student
and lover of British historical antiquities.</p>

<div class="section">
<h2 class="h2herein">INTRODUCTION.</h2>

<p><span class="smcap">G<b>EORGE</b> A<b>LSOP</b>,</span>
the author of this curious tract, was born
according to the inscription on his portrait, in 1638. He
served a two years’ ap­pren­tice­ship to some trade in
London, but seems to have been wild enough. His
portrait and his language alike bespeak the rollicking
roysterer of the days of the restoration, thoroughly
familiar with all the less reputable haunts of London.
He expresses a hearty contempt for Cromwell and his
party, and it may be that the fate which confined him to
a four years’ servitude in Maryland was an order of transportation
issued in the name of the commonwealth of
England. He speaks disdainfully of the “mighty low
and distracted life” of such as could not pay their passage,
then, according to <i>Leah and Rachel</i> (p. 14), generally
six pounds, as though want of money was not in his case
the cause of his emigrating from England. He gives the
letters he wrote to his family and friends on starting, but
omits the date, although from allusions to the death of
Cromwell in a letter dated at Gravesend, September 7th,
he evidently sailed in 1658, the protector having died on
the 3d of September in that year.</p>

<p>In Maryland he fell to the lot of Thomas Stockett, Esq.,
one of three brothers who came
to Maryland in 1658, <span class="xxpn" id="p010">{10}</span>
perhaps at the same time as Alsop, and settled originally
it would seem in Baltimore county. It was on this estate
that Alsop spent the four years which enabled him to
write the following tract. He speaks highly of his treatment
and the abundance that reigned in the Stockett
mansion.</p>

<p>Alsop’s book appeared in 1666. One of the laudatory
verses that preface it is dated January, 1665
(<span class="fract"><span class="fup">5</span><span class="fdn">6</span></span>),
and as it
would appear that he did not remain in Maryland after
the expiration of his four years, except perhaps for a short
time in consequence of a fit of sickness to which he
alludes, he probably returned to London to resume his
old career.</p>

<p>Of his subsequent life nothing is known, and though
Allison ascribes to him a volume of Sermons, we may
safely express our grave doubts whether the author of
this tract can be suspected of anything of the kind.</p>

<p>The book, written in a most extravagant style, contains
no facts as to the stirring events in Maryland history
which preceded its date, and in view, doubtless, of the
still exasperated state of public feeling, seems to have
studiously avoided all allusion to so unattractive a subject.
As an historical tract it derives its chief value from the
portion which comprises its <i>Relation of the Susquehanna
Indians</i>.</p>

<p>The object for which the tract was issued seems evident.
It was designed to stimulate emigration to Maryland, and
is written in a vulgar style to suit the class it was to reach.
While from its dedication to Lord Baltimore, and the
merchant adventurers, we may infer that it was paid for
by them, in order to encourage emigration, especially of
redemptioners. <span class="xxpn" id="p011">{11}</span></p>

<p>Much of the early emigration to America was effected
by what was called the redemption system. Under this,
one disposed to emigrate, but unable to raise the £6,
entered into a contract in the following form, with a
merchant adventurer, ship owner or ship master, and
occasionally with a gentleman emigrant of means, under
which the latter gave him his passage and supplies:</p>

<p>The term of service, at first limited to five years (<i>Relation
of Maryland</i>, 1635, p. 63), was subsequently reduced
to four (Act of 1638, &amp;c.), and so remained
into the next <span class="xxpn" id="p012">{12}</span>
century (Act of April, 1715). Thus a woman in the <i>Sot
Weed Factor</i>, after speaking of her life in England, says:</p>

<div class="dpoemlft"><div class="dstanzalft dkeeptgth">
<div class="dpp00">Not then a slave for twice two year,</div>
<div class="dpp00">My cloaths were fashionably new,</div>
<div class="dpp00">Nor were my shifts of linnen Blue;</div>
<div class="dpp00">But things are changed; now at the Hoe,</div>
<div class="dpp00">I daily work and Barefoot go,</div>
<div class="dpp00">In weeding Corn or feeding Swine,</div>
<div class="dpp00">I spend my melancholy Time.</div>
</div></div>

<p>Disputes arose as to the time when the term began, and
it was finally fixed at the anchoring of the vessel in the
province, but not more than fourteen days were to be
allowed for anchoring after they passed the Capes (Act of
1715). When these agreements were made with the merchant
adventurer, ship owner or ship captain, the servants
were sold at auctions, which were conducted on the principle
of our tax sales, the condition being the payment of
the advances, and the bidding being for the term of
service, descending from the legal limit according to his
supposed value as a mechanic or hand, the best man being
taken for the shortest term. Where the emigrants made
their agreement with the gentleman emigrant, they proceeded
at once to the land he took up, and in the name of
the servant the planter took up at least one hundred acres
of land, fifty of which, under the agreement, he conveyed
to the servant at the expiration of his term of service.</p>

<p>Alsop seems to have made an agreement, perhaps on
the voyage, with Thomas Stockett, Esq., as his first letter
from America mentions his being in the service of that
gentleman. His last letter is dated at Gravesend, the 7th
of September, and his first in Maryland January 17 (1659),
making a voyage of four months, which he loosely calls
five, and describes as “a blowing and
dangerous passage.” <span class="xxpn" id="p013">{13}</span></p>

<p>Through the kindness of George Lynn Lachlin Davis,
Esq., I have been enabled to obtain from J. Shaaf Stockett,
Esq., a descendant of Captain Stockett, some details as to
his ancestor, the master of our author, during his four
years’ servitude, which was not very grievous to him, for
he says, “had I known my yoak would have been so
easie (as I conceive it will) I would have been here long
before now, rather than to have dwelt under the pressure
of a Rebellious and Trayterous government so long as I
did.”</p>

<p>A manuscript statement made some years later by one
Joseph Tilly, states: “About or in y<sup>e</sup> year of o<sup>r</sup> Lord 1667
or 8 I became acquainted w<sup>th</sup> 4 Gent<sup>n</sup> y<sup>t</sup> were brethren &amp;
then dwellers here in Maryland the elder of them went by
y<sup>e</sup> name of Coll<sup>o</sup> Lewis Stockett &amp; y<sup>e</sup> second by y<sup>e</sup> name

redeem their mortgage, w<sup>ch</sup> was y<sup>e</sup> cause of their coming
hither. <span class="dfloatright"><span class="smcap">J<b>OSEPH</b></span>
<span class="smcap">T<b>ILLY</b>.”</span></span></p>

<p class="dclearfix">Of
the brothers, who are said to have arrived in the
spring or summer of 1658, only Captain Thomas Stockett
remained in Maryland, the others having, according to
family tradition, returned to England. As
stated in the <span class="xxpn" id="p014">{14}</span>
document just given, they settled in Anne Arundell
county, and on the 19th of July, 1669, “Obligation,” a
tract of 664 acres of land was patented to Captain Thomas
Stockett, and a part still after the lapse of nearly two
centuries remains in the family, being owned by Frank H.
Stockett, Esq., of the Annapolis bar.</p>

<p>By his wife Mary (<i>Wells</i> it is supposed), Captain Thomas
Stockett had one son, Thomas, born April 17, 1667, from
whose marriage with Mary, daughter of Thomas Sprigg,
of West River, gentleman (March 12, 1689), and subsequent
marriage with Damarris Welch, the Stocketts of
Maryland, Kentucky, Pennsylvania, New York and New
Jersey are descended.</p>

<p>The arms of this branch, as given in the family archives,
are “Or a Lyon rampant sable armed and Langued Gules
a cheife of y<sup>e</sup> second a castle Tripple towred argent
betwixt two Beausants—to y<sup>e</sup> crest upon a helm on a
wreath of y<sup>e</sup> colours, a Lyon Proper segeant supporte on a
stock ragged and trunked argent Borne by the name of
Stockett with a mantle Gules doubled Argent.” These
agree with the arms given by Burke as the arms of the
Stocketts of St. Stephens, county of Kent.</p>

<p>Thomas Stockett’s will, dated April 23, 1671, was
proved on the 4th of May in the same year, so that his
death must have occurred within the ten intervening days.
He left his estate to his wife for life, then his lands to his
son Thomas, and his posthumous child if a son, and his
personal estate to be divided among his daughters. His
executors were his brothers Francis and Henry and his
brother (in-law) Richard Wells. His dispositions of property
are brief, much of the will consisting of pious
expressions and wishes. <span class="xxpn" id="p015">{15}</span></p>

<p>To return to the early Maryland emigration, at the time
there was evident need for some popular tract to remove a
prejudice that had been created against that colony, especially
in regard to the redemptioners. The condition of
those held for service in Maryland had been represented
as pitiable indeed, the labor intolerable, the usage bad,
the diet hard, and that no beds were allowed but the bare
boards. Such calumnies had already been refuted in
1656 by Hammond, in his <i>Leah and Rachel</i>. Yet it
would seem that ten years later the proprietor of Maryland
found it necessary to give Alsop’s flattering picture
as a new antidote.</p>

<p>The original tract is reproduced so nearly in fac simile
here that lit­tle need be said about it. The original is a
very small vol­ume, the print­ed mat­ter on the page being
only <span class="nowrap">2&#x200a;<span class="fract"><span

Reason why I appear in this place is, lest the
general Reader should conclude I have nothing
to say for my self; and truly he’s in the right on’t,
for I have but little to say (for my self) at this time:
For I have had so large a Journey, and so heavy a
Burden to bring <i>Mary-Land</i> into <i>England</i>, that I am
almost out of breath: I’le promise you after I am
come to my self, you shall hear more of me. Good
Reader, because you see me make a brief Apologetical
excuse for my self, don’t judge me; for I am so self-conceited
of my own merits, that I almost think I
want none. <i>De Lege non judicandum ex solâ linea</i>,
saith the Civilian; We must not pass judgement upon
a Law by one line: And because we see but a small
Bush at a Tavern door, conclude there is no Canary
(see
note No. <a href="#note06" title="go to n&#x6f;te 6">6</a>)
For as in our vulgar Resolves ’tis
said, <i>A good face needs no Band, and an ill one deserves
none</i>: So the French Proverb sayes, Bon Vien il n’a
faut point de Ensigne, Good Wine needs no Bush. I
suppose by this time some of my
speculative observers <span class="xxpn" id="p026">{26}</span>
have judged me vainglorious; but if they did but
rightly consider me, they would not be so censorious.
For I dwell so far from Neighbors, that if I do not
praise my self, no body else will: And since I am left
alone, I am resolved to summon the <i>Magna Charta</i> of
Fowles to the Bar for my excuse, and by their irrevocable
Statutes plead my discharge. <i>For its an ill
Bird will befoule her own Nest</i>: Besides, I have a
thousand <i>Billings-gate</i> (see
note No. <a href="#note07" title="go to n&#x6f;te 7">7</a>)
Collegians that
will give in their testimony, <i>That they never knew a
Fish-woman cry stinking Fish</i>. Thus leaving the
Nostrils of the Citizens Wives to demonstrate what
they please as to that, and thee (Good Reader) to say
what thou wilt, I bid thee Farewel.</p>

<span class="fsz0 splineha">M</span></span>ARY-LAND
is a Pro­vince sit­uated upon the
large ex­tending bowels of <i>America</i>, under the
Govern­ment of the Lord <i>Baltemore</i>, ad­ja­cent North­wardly
upon the Con­fines of <i>New-England</i>, and
neigh­bour­ing South­wardly upon <i>Virginia</i>, dwel­ling
pleas­ant­ly upon the Bay of <i>Chæsapike</i> (see
note No.
<a href="#note11" title="go to n&#x6f;te 11">11</a>)
between the Degrees of 36 and 38, in the Zone
temperate, and by Mathematical computation is eleven
hundred and odd Leagues in Longitude from <i>England</i>,
being within her own imbraces extraordinary pleasant
and fertile. Pleasant, in respect of the multitude of
Navigable Rivers and Creeks that conveniently and
most profitably lodge within the armes of her green,
spreading, and delightful Woods; whose natural
womb (by her plenty) maintains and preserves the
several diversities of Animals that rangingly inhabit
her Woods; as she doth otherwise
generously fructifie <span class="xxpn" id="p036">{36}</span>
this piece of Earth with almost all sorts of Vegetables,
as well Flowers with their varieties of colours and
smells, as Herbes and Roots with their several effects
and operative virtues, that offer their benefits daily to
supply the want of the Inhabitant whene’re their
necessities shall <i>Sub-pœna</i> them to wait on their commands.
So that he, who out of curiosity desires to
see the Landskip of the Creation drawn to the life, or
to read Natures universal Herbal without book, may
with the Opticks of a discreet discerning, view <i>Mary-Land</i>
drest in her green and fragrant Mantle of the
Spring. Neither do I think there is any place under
the Heavenly altitude, or that has footing or room
upon the circular Globe of this world, that can parallel
this fertile and pleasant piece of ground in its multiplicity,
or rather Natures extravagancy of a superabounding
plenty. For so much doth this Country
increase in a swelling Spring-tide of rich variety and
diversities of all things, not only common provisions
that supply the reaching stomach of man with a
satisfactory plenty, but also extends with its liberality
and free convenient benefits to each sensitive faculty,
according to their several desiring Appetites. So that
had Nature made it her business, on purpose to have
found out a situation for the Soul of profitable Ingenuity,
she could not have fitted herself better in the
traverse of the whole Universe, nor in convenienter
terms have told man, <i>Dwell here, live plentifully and
be rich</i>. <span class="xxpn" id="p037">{37}</span></p>

<p>The Trees, Plants, Fruits, Flowers, and Roots that
grow here in <i>Mary-Land</i>, are the only Emblems or
Hieroglyphicks of our Adamitical or Primitive situation,
as well for their variety as odoriferous smells,
together with their vertues, according to their several
effects, kinds and properties, which still bear the Effigies
of Innocency according to their original Grafts;
which by their dumb vegetable Oratory, each hour
speaks to the Inhabitant in silent acts, That they
need not look for any other Terrestrial Paradice, to
suspend or tyre their curiosity upon, while she is
extant. For within her doth dwell so much of
variety, so much of natural plenty, that there is not
any thing that is or may be rare, but it inhabits
within this plentious soyle: So that those parts of
the Creation that have borne the Bell away (for many
ages) for a vegetable plentiousness, must now in
silence strike and vayle all, and whisper softly in the
auditual parts of <i>Mary-Land</i>, that <i>None but she in this
dwells singular</i>; and that as well for that she doth
exceed in those Fruits, Plants, Trees and Roots, that
dwell and grow in their several Clymes or habitable
parts of the Earth besides, as the rareness and super-excellency
of her own glory, which she flourishly
abounds in, by the abundancy of reserved Rarities,
such as the remainder of the World (with all its
speculative art) never bore any occular testimony of
as yet. I shall forbear to particularize those several
sorts of vegetables that flourishingly
grows here, by <span class="xxpn" id="p038">{38}</span>
reason of the vast tediousness that will attend upon
the description, which therefore makes them much
more fit for an Herbal, than a small Manuscript or
History. (See note No. <a href="#note12" title="go to n&#x6f;te 12">12</a>).</p>

<p>As for the wilde Animals of this Country, which
loosely inhabits the Woods in multitudes, it is impossible
to give you an exact description of them all,
considering the multiplicity as well as the diversity of
so numerous an extent of Creatures: But such as has
fallen within the compass or prospect of my knowledge,
those you shall know of; <i>videlicet</i>, the Deer, because
they are oftner seen, and more participated of by the
Inhabitants of the Land, whose acquaintance by a
customary familiarity becomes much more common
than the rest of Beasts that inhabit the Woods by
using themselves in Herds about the Christian Plantations.
Their flesh, which in some places of this
Province is the common provision the Inhabitants
feed on, and which through the extreme glut and
plenty of it, being daily killed by the <i>Indians</i>, and
brought in to the <i>English</i>, as well as that which is
killed by the Christian Inhabitant, that doth it more
for recreation, than for the benefit they reap by it.
I say, the flesh of Venison becomes (as to food) rather
denyed, than any way esteemed or desired. And this
I speak from an experimental knowledge; For when
I was under a Command, and debarr’d of a four years
ranging Liberty in the Province of <i>Mary-Land</i>, the
Gentleman whom I served
my conditional and <span class="xxpn" id="p039">{39}</span>
prefixed time withall, had at one time in his house fourscore
Venisons, besides plenty of other provisions to
serve his Family nine months, they being but seven
in number; so that before this Venison was brought
to a period by eating, it so nauseated our appetites
and stomachs, that plain bread was rather courted
and desired than it.</p>

<p>The Deer (see
note No. <a href="#note13" title="go to n&#x6f;te 13">13</a>)
here neither in shape
nor action differ from our Deer in <i>England</i>: the Park
they traverse their ranging and unmeasured walks in,
is bounded and impanell’d in with no other pales than
the rough and billowed Ocean: They are also mighty
numerous in the Woods, and are little or not at all
affrighted at the face of a man, but (like the Does of
<i>Whetstons</i> Park) (see
note No. <a href="#note14" title="go to n&#x6f;te 14">14</a>)
though their hydes
are not altogether so gaudy to extract an admiration
from the beholder, yet they will stand (all most) till
they be scratcht.</p>

<p>As for the Wolves, Bears, and Panthers (see
note
No. <a href="#note15" title="go to n&#x6f;te 15">15</a>)
of this Country, they inhabit commonly in
great multitudes up in the remotest parts of the Continent;
yet at some certain time they come down
near the Plantations, but do little hurt or injury
worth noting, and that which they do is of so degenerate
and low a nature, (as in reference to the fierceness
and heroick vigour that dwell in the same kind of
Beasts in other Countries), that they are hardly worth
mentioning: For the highest of their designs and
circumventing reaches is but
cowardly
and base, only <span class="xxpn" id="p040">{40}</span>
to steal a poor Pigg, or kill a lost and half starved
Calf. The Effigies of a man terrifies them dreadfully,
for they no sooner espy him but their hearts are at
their mouths, and the spurs upon their heels, they
(having no more manners than Beasts) gallop away,
and never bid them farewell that are behind them.</p>

<p>The Elke, the Cat of the Mountain, the Rackoon,
the Fox, the Beaver, the Otter, the Possum, the Hare,
the Squirril, the Monack, the Musk-Rat (see
note
No. <a href="#note16" title="go to n&#x6f;te 16">16</a>)
and several others (whom I’le omit for
brevity sake) inhabit here in <i>Mary-Land</i> in several
droves and troops, ranging the Woods at their
pleasure.</p>

<p>The meat of most of these Creatures is good for
eating, yet of no value nor esteem here, by reason of
the great plenty of other provisions, and are only
kill’d by the <i>Indians</i> of the Country for their Hydes
and Furrs, which become very profitable to those that
have the right way of traffiquing for them, as well as
it redounds to the <i>Indians</i> that take the pains to catch
them, and to slay and dress their several Hydes,
selling and disposing them for such commodities as
their Heathenish fancy delights in.</p>

<p>As for those Beasts that were carried over at the
first seating of the Country, to stock and increase the
situation, as Cows, Horses, Sheep and Hogs (see
note
No. <a href="#note17" title="go to n&#x6f;te 17">17</a>)
they are generally tame, and use near home,
especially the Cows, Sheep and Horses. The Hogs,
whose increase is innumerable in
the Woods, do <span class="xxpn" id="p041">{41}</span>
disfrequent home more than the rest of Creatures that
are look’d upon as tame, yet with little trouble and
pains they are slain and made provision of. Now
they that will with a right Historical Survey, view
the Woods of <i>Mary-Land</i> in this particular, as in
reference to Swine, must upon necessity judge this
Land lineally descended from the <i>Gadarean</i> Territories.
(See note No. <a href="#note18" title="go to n&#x6f;te 18">18</a>.)</p>

<p><i>Mary-Land</i> (I must confess) cannot boast of her
plenty of Sheep here, as other Countries; not but
that they will thrive and increase here, as well as in
any place of the World besides, but few desire them,
because they commonly draw down the Wolves among
the Plantations, as well by the sweetness of their
flesh, as by the humility of their nature, in not
making a defensive resistance against the rough dealing
of a ravenous Enemy. They who for curiosity
will keep Sheep, may expect that after the Wolves
have breathed themselves all day in the Woods to
sharpen their stomachs, they will come without fail
and sup with them at night, though many times they
surfeit themselves with the sawce that’s dish’d out of
the muzzle of a Gun, and so in the midst of their
banquet (poor Animals) they often sleep with their
Ancestors.</p>

<p>Fowls of all sorts and varieties dwell at their several
times and seasons here in <i>Mary-Land</i>. The Turkey,
the Woodcock, the Pheasant, the Partrich, the Pigeon,
and others, especially the Turkey, whom
I have seen <span class="xxpn" id="p042">{42}</span>
in whole hundreds in flights in the Woods of <i>Mary-Land</i>,
being an extraordinary fat Fowl, whose flesh
is very pleasant and sweet. These Fowls that I have
named are intayled from generation to generation to
the Woods. The Swans, the Geese and Ducks (with
other Water-Fowl) derogate in this point of setled
residence; for they arrive in millionous multitudes in
<i>Mary-Land</i> about the middle of <i>September</i>, and take
their winged farewell about the midst of <i>March</i> (see
note No. <a href="#note19" title="go to n&#x6f;te 19">19</a>)
But while they do remain, and beleagure
the borders of the shoar with their winged
Dragoons, several of them are summoned by a Writ
of <i>Fieri facias</i>, to answer their presumptuous contempt
upon a Spit.</p>

<p>As for Fish, which dwell in the watry tenements
of the deep, and by a providential greatness of power,
is kept for the relief of several Countries in the world
(which would else sink under the rigid enemy of
want), here in <i>Mary-Land</i> is a large sufficiency, and
plenty of almost all sorts of Fishes, which live and
inhabit within her several Rivers and Creeks, far
beyond the apprehending or crediting of those that
never saw the same, which with very much ease is
catched, to the great refreshment of the Inhabitants
of the Province.</p>

<p>All sorts of Grain, as Wheat, Rye, Barley, Oates,
Pease, besides several others that have their original
and birth from the fertile womb of this Land (and no
where else), they all grow, increase,
and thrive here <span class="xxpn" id="p043">{43}</span>
in <i>Mary-Land</i>, without the chargable and laborious
manuring of the Land with Dung; increasing in such
a measure and plenty, by the natural richness of the
Earth, with the common, beneficial and convenient
showers of rain that usually wait upon the several
Fields of Grain (by a natural instinct), so that Famine
(the dreadful Ghost of penury and want) is never
known with his pale visage to haunt the Dominions
of <i>Mary-Land</i>. (See note No. <a href="#note20" title="go to n&#x6f;te 20">20</a>).</p>

<h2 class="h2herein">CHAP. II.
<span class="hsmall spitalic">Of the Government and Natural Disposition of the
People.</span></h2>

<p class="pfirst"><span class="ddropcapbox">
<span class="fsz0 splineha">M</span></span>ARY-LAND,
not from the remoteness of her
situation, but from the regularity of her well
ordered Government, may (without sin, I think) be
called <i>Singular</i>: And though she is not supported
with such large Revenues as some of her Neighbours
are, yet such is her wisdom in a reserved silence, and
not in pomp, to shew her well-conditioned Estate, in
relieving at a distance the proud poverty of those that
wont be seen they want, as well as those which by
undeniable necessities are drove upon the Rocks of
pinching wants: Yet such a loathsome creature is a
common and folding-handed Beggar, that upon the
penalty of almost a perpetual working in Imprisonment,
they are not to appear, nor lurk near our
vigilant and laborious dwellings. The Country hath
received a general spleen and antipathy against the
very name and nature of it; and though there were
no Law provided (as there is) to suppress it, I am
certainly confident, there is none within the Province
that would lower themselves so much below the dignity
of men to beg, as long as limbs and life keep
house together; so much is a vigilant industrious care
esteem’d. <span class="xxpn" id="p045">{45}</span></p>

<p>He that desires to see the real Platform of a quiet
and sober Government extant, Superiority with a
meek and yet commanding power sitting at the
Helme, steering the actions of State quietly, through
the multitude and diversity of Opinionous waves that
diversly meet, let him look on <i>Mary-Land</i> with eyes
admiring, and he’ll then judge her, <i>The Miracle of
this Age</i>.</p>

<p>Here the <i>Roman Catholick</i>, and the <i>Protestant Episcopal</i>
(whom the world would perswade have proclaimed
open Wars irrevocably against each other),
contrarywise concur in an unanimous parallel of
friendship, and inseparable love intayled into one
another: All Inquisitions, Martyrdom, and Banishments
are not so much as named, but unexpressably
abhorr’d by each other.</p>

<p>The several Opinions and Sects that lodge within
this Government, meet not together in mutinous contempts
to disquiet the power that bears Rule, but
with a reverend quietness obeys the legal commands
of Authority. (See note No. <a href="#note21" title="go to n&#x6f;te 21">21</a>)
Here’s never seen
Five Monarchies in a Zealous Rebellion, opposing the
Rights and Liberties of a true setled Government, or
Monarchical Authority: Nor did I ever see (here in
<i>Mary-Land</i>) any of those dancing Adamitical Sisters,
that plead a primitive Innocency for their base
obscenity, and naked deportment; but I conceive if
some of them were there at some certain time of the
year, between the Months of
<i>January</i> and <i>February</i>, <span class="xxpn" id="p046">{46}</span>
when the winds blow from the North-West quarter of
the world, that it would both cool, and (I believe)
convert the hottest of these Zealots from their burning
and fiercest concupiscence. (See note No. <a href="#note22" title="go to n&#x6f;te 22">22</a>).</p>

<p>The Government of this Province doth continually,
by all lawful means, strive to purge her Dominions
from such base corroding humors, that would predominate
upon the least smile of Liberty, did not the Laws
check and bridle in those unwarranted and tumultuous
Opinions. And truly, where a kingdom, State or
Government, keeps or cuts down the weeds of destructive
Opinions, there must certainly be a blessed harmony
of quietness. And I really believe this Land or
Government of <i>Mary-Land</i> may boast, that she enjoys
as much quietness from the disturbance of Rebellious
Opinions, as most States or Kingdoms do in the
world: For here every man lives quietly, and follows
his labour and imployment desiredly; and by the
protection of the Laws, they are supported from those
molestious troubles that ever attend upon the Commons
of other States and Kingdoms, as well as from
the Aquafortial operation of great and eating Taxes.
Here’s nothing to be levyed out of the Granaries of
Corn; but contrarywise, by a Law every Domestick
Governor of a Family is enjoyned to make or cause

thin-jawed Skeliton with his starv’d

<p>Once every year within this Province is an Assembly
called, and out of every respective County (by the
consent of the people) there is chosen a number of
men, and to them is deliver’d up the Grievances of the
Country; and they maturely debate the matters, and
according to their Consciences make Laws for the
general good of the people; and where any former
Law that was made, seems and is prejudicial to the
good or quietness of the Land, it is repeal’d. These
men that determine on these matters for the Republique,
are called Burgesses, and they commonly sit in
Junto about six weeks, being for the most part good
ordinary Householders of the several Counties, which
do more by a plain and honest Conscience, than by
artificial Syllogisms drest up in gilded Orations. (See
note No. <a href="#note24" title="go to n&#x6f;te 24">24</a>).</p>

<p>Here Suits and Tryals in Law seldome hold dispute
two Terms or Courts, but according as the Equity of
the Cause appears is brought to a period. (See note
No. <a href="#note25" title="go to n&#x6f;te 25">25</a>)
The <i>Temples</i> and <i>Grays-Inne</i> are clear out
of fashion here: Marriot (see
note No. <a href="#note26" title="go to n&#x6f;te 26">26</a>)
would
sooner get a paunch-devouring meal for nothing, than
for his invading Counsil. Here if the Lawyer had
nothing else to maintain him but his bawling, he
might button up his Chops, and burn his Buckrom
Bag, or else hang it upon a pin untill its Antiquity
had eaten it up with durt and dust:
Then with a <span class="xxpn" id="p048">{48}</span>
Spade, like his Grandsire <i>Adam</i>, turn up the face of
the Creation, purchasing his bread by the sweat of his
brows, that before was got by the motionated Water-works
of his jaws. So contrary to the Genius of the
people, if not to the quiet Government of the Province,
that the turbulent Spirit of continued and vexatious
Law, with all its querks and evasions, is openly and
most eagerly opposed, that might make matters either
dubious, tedious, or troublesom. All other matters
that would be ranging in contrary and improper
Spheres, (in short) are here by the Power moderated,
lower’d and subdued. All villanous Outrages that
are committed in other States, are not so much as
known here: A man may walk in the open Woods
as secure from being externally dissected, as in his
own house or dwelling. So hateful is a Robber, that
if but once imagin’d to be so, he’s kept at a distance,
and shun’d as the Pestilential noysomness. (See note
No. <a href="#note27" title="go to n&#x6f;te 27">27</a>).</p>

<p>It is generally and very remarkably observed, That
those whose Lives and Conversations have had no
other gloss nor glory stampt on them in their own
Country, but the stigmatization of baseness, were here
(by the common civilities and deportments of the
Inhabitants of this Province) brought to detest and
loath their former actions. Here the Constable hath
no need of a train of Holberteers (see
note No. <a href="#note28" title="go to n&#x6f;te 28">28</a>),
that carry more Armour about them, than heart to
guard him: Nor is he ever troubled
to leave his <span class="xxpn" id="p049">{49}</span>
Feathered Nest to some friendly successor, while he
is placing of his Lanthern-horn Guard at the end of
some suspicious Street, to catch some Night-walker,
or Batchelor of Leachery, that has taken his Degree
three story high in a Bawdy-house. Here’s no <i>Newgates</i>
for pilfering Felons, nor <i>Ludgates</i> for Debtors,
nor any <i>Bridewels</i> (see
note No. <a href="#note29" title="go to n&#x6f;te 29">29</a>)
to lash the soul
of Concupiscence into a chast Repentance. For as
there is none of these Prisons in <i>Mary-Land</i>, so the
merits of the Country deserves none, but if any be
foully vitious, he is so reserv’d in it, that he seldom
or never becomes popular. Common Alehouses (whose
dwellings are the only Receptacles of debauchery and
baseness, and those Schools that trains up Youth, as
well as Age, to ruine), in this Province there are
none; neither hath Youth his swing or range in such
a profuse and unbridled liberty as in other Countries;
for from an antient Custom at the primitive seating
of the place, the Son works as well as the Servant (an
excellent cure for untam’d Youth), so that before they
eat their bread, they are commonly taught how to
earn it; which makes them by that time Age speaks
them capable of receiving that which their Parents
indulgency is ready to give them, and which partly
is by their own laborious industry purchased, they
manage it with such a serious, grave and watching
care, as if they had been Masters of Families, trained
up in that domestick and governing power from their
Cradles. These Christian Natives
of the Land, <span class="xxpn" id="p050">{50}</span>
especially those of the Masculine Sex, are generally conveniently
confident, reservedly subtile, quick in
apprehending, but slow in resolving; and where they
spy profit sailing towards them with the wings of a
prosperous gale, there they become much familiar.
The Women differ something in this point, though
not much: They are extreme bashful at the first
view, but after a continuance of time hath brought
them acquainted, there they become discreetly familiar,
and are much more talkative then men. All
Complemental Courtships, drest up in critical Rarities,
are meer strangers to them, plain wit comes nearest
their Genius; so that he that intends to Court a
<i>Mary-Land</i> Girle, must have something more than
the Tautologies of a long-winded speech to carry on
his design, or else he may (for ought I know) fall
under the contempt of her frown, and his own windy
Oration. (See note No. <a href="#note30" title="go to n&#x6f;te 30">30</a>).</p>

<p>One great part of the Inhabitants of this Province
are desiredly Zealous, great pretenders to Holiness;
and where any thing appears that carries on the
Frontispiece of its Effigies the stamp of Religion,
though fundamentally never so imperfect, they are
suddenly taken with it, and out of an eager desire to
any thing that’s new, not weighing the sure matter in
the Ballance of Reason, are very apt to be catcht.
(See note No. <a href="#note31" title="go to n&#x6f;te 31">31</a>)

The

as well as in other places, since the Ghost of <i>John</i> of
<i>Leyden</i> haunts their Conventicles. The <i>Adamite</i>,
<i>Ranter</i>, and <i>Fifty-Monarchy men</i>, <i>Mary-Land</i> cannot,
nay will not digest within her liberal stomach such
corroding morsels: So that this Province is an utter
Enemy to blasphemous and zealous Imprecations,
drain’d from the Lymbeck of hellish and damnable
Spirits, as well as profuse prophaness, that issues from
the prodigality of none but cract-brain Sots.</p>

<span class="hsmall spitalic">The necessariness of

there can be no Monarchy without the Supremacy
of a King and Crown, nor no King without
Subjects, nor any Parents without it be by the
fruitful off-spring of Children; neither can there be
any Masters, unless it be by the inferior Servitude of
those that dwell under them, by a commanding enjoynment:
And since it is ordained from the original
and superabounding wisdom of all things, That there
should be Degrees and Diversities amongst the Sons
of men, in acknowledging of a Superiority from Inferiors
to Superiors; the Servant with a reverent and
befitting Obedience is as liable to this duty in a
measurable performance to him whom he serves, as
the loyalest of Subjects to his Prince. Then since it
is a common and ordained Fate, that there must be
Servants as well as Masters, and that good Servitudes
are those Colledges of Sobriety that checks in the
giddy and wild-headed youth from his profuse and
uneven course of life, by a limited constrainment, as
well as it otherwise agrees with the moderate and discreet
Servant: Why should there be
such an exclusive <span class="xxpn" id="p053">{53}</span>
Obstacle in the minds and unreasonable dispositions
of many people, against the limited time of convenient
and necessary Servitude, when it is a thing so requisite,
that the best of Kingdoms would be unhing’d
from their quiet and well setled Government without
it. Which levelling doctrine we here of <i>England</i> in
this latter age (whose womb was truss’d out with
nothing but confused Rebellion) have too much experienced,
and was daily rung into the ears of the
tumultuous Vulgar by the Bell-weather Sectaries of
the Times: But (blessed be God) those Clouds are
blown over, and the Government of the Kingdom
coucht under a more stable form.</p>

<p>There is no truer Emblem of Confusion either in
Monarchy or Domestick Governments, then when
either the Subject, or the Servant, strives for the
upper hand of his Prince, or Master, and to be equal
with him, from whom he receives his present subsistance:
Why then, if Servitude be so necessary that no
place can be governed in order, nor people live without
it, this may serve to tell those which prick up their
ears and bray against it, That they are none but
Asses, and deserve the Bridle of a strict commanding
power to reine them in: For I’me certainly confident,
that there are several Thousands in most Kingdoms
of Christendom, that could not at all live and subsist,
unless they had served some prefixed time, to learn
either some Trade, Art, or Science, and by either of
them to extract
their present livelihood. <span class="xxpn" id="p054">{54}</span></p>

<p>Then methinks this may stop the mouths of those
that will undiscreetly compassionate them that dwell
under necessary Servitudes; for let but Parents of
an indifferent capacity in Estates, when their Childrens
age by computation speak them seventeen or
eighteen years old, turn them loose to the wide world,
without a seven years working Apprenticeship (being
just brought up to the bare formality of a little reading
and writing) and you shall immediately see how
weak and shiftless they’le be towards the maintaining
and supporting of themselves; and (without either
stealing or begging) their bodies like a Sentinel must
continually wait to see when their Souls will be
frighted away by the pale Ghost of a starving want.</p>

<p>Then let such, where Providence hath ordained to
live as Servants, either in <i>England</i> or beyond Sea,
endure the prefixed yoak of their limited time with
patience, and then in a small computation of years,
by an industrious endeavour, they may become Masters
and Mistresses of Families themselves. And let
this be spoke to the deserved praise of <i>Mary-Land</i>,
That the four years I served there were not to me so
slavish, as a two years Servitude of a Handicraft
Apprenticeship was here in <i>London</i>; <i>Volenti enim nil
difficile</i>: Not that I write this to seduce or delude
any, or to draw them from their native soyle, but out
of a love to my Countrymen, whom in the general I
wish well to, and that the lowest of them may live in
such a capacity of Estate, as that the
bare interest of <span class="xxpn" id="p055">{55}</span>
their Livelihoods might not altogether depend upon
persons of the greatest extendments.</p>

<p>Now those whose abilities here in <i>England</i> are
capable of maintaining themselves in any reasonable
and handsom manner, they had best so to remain,
lest the roughness of the Ocean, together with the
staring visages of the wilde Animals, which they
may see after their arrival into the Country, may
alter the natural dispositions of their bodies, that
the stay’d and solid part that kept its motion by
Doctor <i>Trigs</i> purgationary operation, may run beyond
the byas of the wheel in a violent and laxative confusion.</p>

<p>Now contrarywise, they who are low, and make
bare shifts to buoy themselves up above the shabby
center of beggarly and incident casualties, I heartily
could wish the removal of some of them into <i>Mary-Land</i>,
which would make much better for them that
stay’d behind, as well as it would advantage those
that went.</p>

<p>They whose abilities cannot extend to purchase
their own transportation into <i>Mary-Land</i> (and surely
he that cannot command so small a sum for so great
a matter, his life must needs be mighty low and
dejected), I say they may for the debarment of a four
years sordid liberty, go over into this Province and
there live plentiously well. And what’s a four years
Servitude to advantage a man all the remainder of
his dayes, making his predecessors
happy in his <span class="xxpn" id="p056">{56}</span>
sufficient abilities, which he attained to partly by the
restrainment of so small a time?</p>

<p>Now those that commit themselves into the care of
the Merchant to carry them over, they need not
trouble themselves with any inquisitive search touching
their Voyage; for there is such an honest care
and provision made for them all the time they remain
aboard the Ship, and are sailing over, that they want
for nothing that is necessary and convenient.</p>

<p>The Merchant commonly before they go aboard the
Ship, or set themselves in any forwardness for their
Voyage, has Conditions of Agreements drawn between
him and those that by a voluntary consent become
his Servants, to serve him, his Heirs or Assigns,
according as they in their primitive acquaintance
have made their bargain (see
note No. <a href="#note34" title="go to n&#x6f;te 34">34</a>)
some two,
some three, some four years; and whatever the Master
or Servant tyes himself up to here in <i>England</i> by
Condition, the Laws of the Province will force a performance
of when they come there: Yet here is this
Priviledge in it when they arrive, If they dwell not
with the Merchant they made their first agreement
withall, they may choose whom they will serve their
prefixed time with; and after their curiosity has
pitcht on one whom they think fit for their turn, and
that they may live well withall, the Merchant makes
an Assignment of the Indenture over to him whom
they of their free will have chosen to be their Master,
in the same nature as we here in
<i>England</i> (and no <span class="xxpn" id="p057">{57}</span>
otherwise) turn over Covenant Servants or Apprentices
from one Master to another. Then let those
whose chaps are always breathing forth those filthy
dregs of abusive exclamations, which are Lymbeckt
from their sottish and preposterous brains, against
this Country of <i>Mary-Land</i>, saying, That those which
are transported over thither, are sold in open Market
for Slaves, and draw in Carts like Horses; which is
so damnable an untruth, that if they should search to
the very Center of Hell, and enquire for a Lye of the
most antient and damned stamp, I confidently believe
they could not find one to parallel this: For know,
That the Servants here in <i>Mary-Land</i> of all Colonies,
distant or remote Plantations, have the least cause to
complain, either for strictness of Servitude, want of
Provisions, or need of Apparel: Five dayes and a half
in the Summer weeks is the alotted time that they
work in; and for two months, when the Sun predominates
in the highest pitch of his heat, they claim an
antient and customary Priviledge, to repose themselves
three hours in the day within the house, and this is
undeniably granted to them that work in the Fields.</p>

<p>In the Winter time, which lasteth three months
(viz.), <i>December</i>, <i>January</i>, and <i>February</i>, they do little
or no work or imployment, save cutting of wood to
make good fires to sit by, unless their Ingenuity will
prompt them to hunt the Deer, or Bear, or recreate
themselves in Fowling, to slaughter the Swans, Geese,
and Turkeys (which this Country affords
in a most <span class="xxpn" id="p058">{58}</span>
plentiful manner): For every Servant has a Gun,
Powder and Shot allowed him, to sport him withall
on all Holidayes and leasurable times, if he be capable
of using it, or be willing to learn.</p>

<p>Now those Servants which come over into this
Province, being Artificers, they never (during their
Servitude) work in the Fields, or do any other imployment
save that which their Handicraft and Mechanick
endeavours are capable of putting them upon, and are
esteem’d as well by their Masters, as those that imploy
them, above measure. He that’s a Tradesman here
in <i>Mary-Land</i> (though a Servant), lives as well as
most common Handicrafts do in <i>London</i>, though they
may want something of that Liberty which Freemen
have, to go and come at their pleasure; yet if it were
rightly understood and considered, what most of the
Liberties of the several poor Tradesmen are taken up
about, and what a care and trouble attends that thing
they call Liberty, which according to the common
translation is but Idleness, and (if weighed in the
Ballance of a just Reason) will be found to be much
heavier and cloggy then the four years restrainment
of a <i>Mary-Land</i> Servitude. He that lives in the
nature of a Servant in this Province, must serve but
four years by the Custom of the Country; and when
the expiration of his time speaks him a Freeman,
there’s a Law in the Province, that enjoyns his Master
whom he hath served to give him Fifty Acres of Land,
Corn to serve him a whole year, three
Suits of Apparel, <span class="xxpn" id="p059">{59}</span>
with things necessary to them, and Tools to work
withall; so that they are no sooner free, but they are
ready to set up for themselves, and when once entred,
they live passingly well. (See note No. <a href="#note35" title="go to n&#x6f;te 35">35</a>).</p>

<p>The Women that go over into this Province as Servants,
have the best luck here as in any place of the
world besides; for they are no sooner on shoar, but
they are courted into a Copulative Matrimony, which
some of them (for aught I know) had they not come to
such a Market with their Virginity, might have kept
it by them untill it had been mouldy, unless they had
let it out by a yearly rent to some of the Inhabitants
of <i>Lewknors-Lane</i> (see
note No. <a href="#note36" title="go to n&#x6f;te 36">36</a>)
or made a Deed
of Gift of it to Mother <i>Coney</i>, having only a poor
stipend out of it, untill the Gallows or Hospital called
them away. Men have not altogether so good luck
as Women in this kind, or natural preferment, without
they be good Rhetoricians, and well vers’d in the
Art of perswasion, then (probably) they may ryvet
themselves in the time of their Servitude into the
private and reserved favour of their Mistress, if Age
speak their Master deficient.</p>

<p>In short, touching the Servants of this Province,
they live well in the time of their Service, and by
their restrainment in that time, they are made capable
of living much better when they come to be free;
which in several other parts of the world I have
observed, That after some servants have brought their
indented and limited time to a just
and legal period <span class="xxpn" id="p060">{60}</span>
by Servitude, they have been much more incapable of
supporting themselves from sinking into the Gulf of a
slavish, poor, fettered, and intangled life, then all the
fastness of their prefixed time did involve them in
before.</p>

<p>Now the main and principal Reason of those incident
casualties, that wait continually upon the residences
of most poor Artificers, is (I gather) from the
multiciplicity or innumerableness of those several
Companies of Tradesmen, that dwell so closely and
stiflingly together in one and the same place, that
like the chafing Gum in Watered-Tabby, they eat into
the folds of one anothers Estates. And this might
easily be remedied, would but some of them remove
and disperse distantly where want and necessity calls
for them; their dwellings (I am confident) would be
much larger, and their conditions much better, as well
in reference to their Estates, as to the satisfactoriness
of their minds, having a continual imployment, and
from that imployment a continual benefit, without
either begging, seducing, or flattering for it, encroaching
that one month from one of the same profession,
that they are heaved out themselves the next. For
I have observed on the other side of <i>Mary-Land</i>, that
the whole course of most Mechanical endeavours, is
to catch, snatch, and undervalue one another, to get
a little work, or a Customer; which when they have
attained by their lowbuilt and sneaking circumventings,
it stands upon so flashy,
mutable, and transitory <span class="xxpn" id="p061">{61}</span>
a foundation, that the best of his hopes is commonly
extinguisht before the poor undervalued Tradesman
is warm in the enjoyment of his Customer.</p>

<p>Then did not a cloud of low and base Cowardize
eclipse the Spirits of these men, these things might
easily be diverted; but they had as live take a Bear
by the tooth, as think of leaving their own Country,
though they live among their own National people,
and are governed by the same Laws they have here,
yet all this wont do with them; and all the Reason
they can render to the contrary is, There’s a great
Sea betwixt them and <i>Mary-Land</i>, and in that Sea
there are Fishes, and not only Fishes but great Fishes,
and then should a Ship meet with such an inconsiderable
encounter as a Whale, one blow with his
tayle, and then <i>Lord have Mercy upon us</i>: Yet meet
with these men in their common Exchange, which is
one story high in the bottom of a Celler, disputing
over a Black-pot, it would be monstrously dreadful
here to insert the particulars, one swearing that he
was the first that scaled the Walls of <i>Dundee</i>, when
the Bullets flew about their ears as thick as Hailstones
usually fall from the Sky; which if it were but
rightly examined, the most dangerous Engagement
that ever he was in, was but at one of the flashy
battels at <i>Finsbury</i>, (see
note No. <a href="#note37" title="go to n&#x6f;te 37">37</a>)
where commonly
there’s more Custard greedily devoured, than
men prejudiced by the rigour of the War. Others of
this Company relating their
several dreadful exploits, <span class="xxpn" id="p062">{62}</span>
and when they are just entring into the particulars,
let but one step in and interrupt their discourse, by
telling them of a Sea Voyage, and the violency of
storms that attends it, and that there are no back-doors
to run out at, which they call, <i>a handsom
Retreat and Charge again</i>; the apprehensive danger
of this is so powerful and penetrating on them, that a
damp sweat immediately involves their Microcosm,
so that <i>Margery</i> the old Matron of the Celler, is fain
to run for a half-peny-worth of <i>Angelica</i> to rub their
nostrils; and though the Port-hole of their bodies
has been stopt from a convenient Evacuation some
several months, theyl’e need no other Suppository to
open the Orifice of their Esculent faculties then this
Relation, as their Drawers or Breeches can more at
large demonstrate to the inquisitive search of the
curious.</p>

<p>Now I know that some will be apt to judge, that I
have written this last part out of derision to some of
my poor Mechanick Country-men: Truly I must
needs tell those to their face that think so of me, that
they prejudice me extremely, by censuring me as
guilty of any such crime: What I have written is
only to display the sordidness of their dispositions,
who rather than they will remove to another Country
to live plentiously well, and give their Neighbors
more Elbow-room and space to breath in, they will
croud and throng upon one another, with the pressure
of a beggarly
and unnecessary weight. <span class="xxpn" id="p063">{63}</span></p>

<p>That which I have to say more in this business, is
a hearty and desirous wish, that the several poor
Tradesmen here in <i>London</i> that I know, and have
borne an occular testimony of their want, might live
so free from care as I did when I dwelt in the bonds
of a four years Servitude in <i>Mary-Land</i>.</p>

reference to the internal and healthful preservative of
her Inhabitants, for want of those Medicinal Drugs
that are landed upon her Coast every year, as the
external profits, Glory and beneficial Graces that
accrue by her.</p>

<p><i>Paracelsus</i> might knock down his Forge, if Trafique
and Commerce should once cease, and grynde the hilt
of his Sword into Powder, and take some of the Infusion
to make him so valorous, that he
might cut his <span class="xxpn" id="p065">{65}</span>
own Throat in the honor of <i>Mercury</i>: <i>Galen</i> might
then burn his Herbal, and like <i>Joseph of Arimathea</i>,
build him a Tomb in his Garden, and so rest from his
labours: Our Physical Collegians of <i>London</i> would
have no cause then to thunder Fire-balls at <i>Nich. Culpeppers</i>
Dispensatory (see
note No. <a href="#note38" title="go to n&#x6f;te 38">38</a>)
All Herbs,
Roots, and Medicines would bear their original christening,
that the ignorant might understand them:
<i>Album grecum</i> would not be <i>Album grecum</i> (see
note
No. <a href="#note39" title="go to n&#x6f;te 39">39</a>)
then, but a Dogs turd would be a Dogs turd
in plain terms, in spight of their teeth.</p>

<p>If Trade should once cease, the Custom-house would
soon miss her hundreds and thousands Hogs-heads of
Tobacco (see
note No. <a href="#note40" title="go to n&#x6f;te 40">40</a>)
that use to be throng in
her every year, as well as the Grocers would in their
Ware-houses and Boxes, the Gentry and Commonalty
in their Pipes, the Physician in his Drugs and Medicinal
Compositions; The (leering) Waiters for want
of imployment, might (like so many <i>Diogenes</i>) intomb
themselves in their empty Casks, and rouling themselves
off the Key into the <i>Thames</i>, there wander up
and down from tide to tide in contemplation of <i>Aristotles</i>
unresolved curiosity, until the rottenness of their
circular habitation give them a <i>Quietus est</i>, and fairly
surrender them up into the custody of those who both
for profession, disposition and nature, lay as near
claim to them, as if they both tumbled in one belly,
and for name they jump alike, being according to the
original
translation both <i>Sharkes</i>. <span class="xxpn" id="p066">{66}</span></p>

<p>Silks and Cambricks, and Lawns to make sleeves,
would be as soon miss’d at Court, as Gold and Silver
would be in the Mint and Pockets: The Low-Country
Soldier would be at a cold stand for Outlandish Furrs
to make him Muffs, to keep his ten similitudes warm
in the Winter, as well as the Furrier for want of
Skins to uphold his Trade.</p>

<p>Should Commerce once cease, there is no Country
in the habitable world but would undoubtedly miss
that flourishing, splendid and rich gallantry of Equipage,
that Trafique maintained and drest her up in,
before she received that fatal Eclipse: <i>England</i>,
<i>France</i>, <i>Germany</i> and <i>Spain</i>, together with all the
Kingdoms——</p>

<p>But stop (good Muse) lest I should, like the Parson
of <i>Pancras</i> (see
note No. <a href="#note41" title="go to n&#x6f;te 41">41</a>)
run so far from my Text
in half an hour, that a two hours trot back again
would hardly fetch it up: I had best while I am
alive in my Doctrine, to think again of <i>Mary-Land</i>,
lest the business of other Countries take up so much
room in my brain, that I forget and bury her in
oblivion.</p>

<p>The three main Commodities this Country affords
for Trafique, are Tobacco, Furrs, and Flesh. Furrs
and Skins, as Beavers, Otters, Musk-Rats, Rackoons,
Wild-Cats, and Elke or Bufieloe (see
note No. <a href="#note42" title="go to n&#x6f;te 42">42</a>),
with divers others, which were first made vendible by
the <i>Indians</i> of the Country, and sold to the Inhabitant,
and by them to the
Merchant, and so <span class="xxpn" id="p067">{67}</span>
transported into <i>England</i> and other places where it becomes
most commodious.</p>

<p>Tobacco is the only solid Staple Commodity of this
Province: The use of it was first found out by the
<i>Indians</i> many Ages agoe, and transferr’d into Christendom
by that great Discoverer of <i>America Columbus</i>.
It’s generally made by all the Inhabitants of this
Province, and between the months of <i>March</i> and <i>April</i>
they sow the seed (which is much smaller then Mustard-seed)
in small beds and patches digg’d up and
made so by art, and about <i>May</i> the Plants commonly
appear green in those beds: In <i>June</i> they are transplanted
from their beds, and set in little hillocks in
distant rowes, dug up for the same purpose; some
twice or thrice they are weeded, and succoured from
their illegitimate Leaves that would be peeping out
from the body of the Stalk. They top the several
Plants as they find occasion in their predominating
rankness: About the middle of <i>September</i> they cut
the Tobacco down, and carry it into houses, (made
for that purpose) to bring it to its purity: And after
it has attained, by a convenient attendance upon
time, to its perfection, it is then tyed up in bundles,
and packt into Hogs-heads, and then laid by for the
Trade.</p>

<p>Between <i>November</i> and <i>January</i> there arrives in
this Province Shipping to the number of twenty sail
and upwards (see
note No. <a href="#note43" title="go to n&#x6f;te 43">43</a>)
all Merchant-men
loaden with Commodities to Trafique
and dispose of, <span class="xxpn" id="p068">{68}</span>
trucking with the Planter for Silks, Hollands, Serges,
and Broad-clothes, with other necessary Goods, priz’d
at such and such rates as shall be judg’d on is fair
and legal, for Tobacco at so much the pound, and
advantage on both sides considered; the Planter for
his work, and the Merchant for adventuring himself
and his Commodity into so far a Country: Thus is the
Trade on both sides drove on with a fair and honest
<i>Decorum</i>.</p>

<p>The Inhabitants of this Province are seldom or
never put to the affrightment of being robb’d of their
money, nor to dirty their Fingers by telling of vast
sums: They have more bags to carry Corn, then
Coyn; and though they want, but why should I call
that a want which is only a necessary miss? the very
effects of the dirt of this Province affords as great a
profit to the general Inhabitant, as the Gold of <i>Peru</i>
doth to the straight-breecht Commonalty of the
<i>Spaniard</i>.</p>

<p>Our Shops and Exchanges of <i>Mary-Land</i>, are the
Merchants Store-houses, where with few words and
protestations Goods are bought and delivered; not
like those Shop-keepers Boys in <i>London</i>, that continually
cry, <i>What do ye lack Sir? What d’ye buy?</i>
yelping with so wide a mouth, as if some Apothecary
had hired their mouths to stand open to catch Gnats
and Vagabond Flyes in.</p>

<p>Tobacco is the currant Coyn of <i>Mary-Land</i>, and
will sooner purchase Commodities
from the Merchant, <span class="xxpn" id="p069">{69}</span>
then money. I must confess the <i>New-England</i> men
that trade into this Province, had rather have fat
Pork for their Goods, than Tobacco or Furrs (see
note No. <a href="#note44" title="go to n&#x6f;te 44">44</a>)
which I conceive is, because their bodies
being fast bound up with the cords of restringent
Zeal, they are fain to make use of the lineaments
of this <i>Non-Canaanite</i> creature physically to loosen
them; for a bit of a pound upon a two-peny Rye loaf,
according to the original Receipt, will bring the costiv’st
red-ear’d Zealot in some three hours time to a
fine stool, if methodically observed.</p>

<p><i>Medera</i>-Wines, Sugars, Salt, Wickar-Chairs, and
Tin Candlesticks, is the most of the Commodities they
bring in: They arrive in <i>Mary-Land</i> about <i>September</i>,
being most of them Ketches and Barkes, and such
small Vessels, and those dispersing themselves into
several small Creeks of this Province, to sell and dispose
of their Commodities, where they know the
Market is most fit for their small Adventures.</p>

<p><i>Barbadoes</i> (see
note No. <a href="#note45" title="go to n&#x6f;te 45">45</a>)
together with the
several adjacent Islands, has much Provision yearly
from this Province: And though these Sun-burnt
<i>Phaetons</i> think to outvye <i>Mary-Land</i> in their Silks
and Puffs, daily speaking against her whom their
necessities makes them beholding to, and like so
many <i>Don Diegos</i> that becackt <i>Pauls</i>, cock their Felts
and look big upon’t; yet if a man could go down into
their infernals, and see how it fares with them there,
I believe he would hardly find any
other Spirit to <span class="xxpn" id="p070">{70}</span>
buoy them up, then the ill-visaged Ghost of want,
that continually wanders from gut to gut to feed upon
the undigested rynes of Potatoes.</p>

the di­vers­i­ties of Lang­uages (since Babels con­fu­sion)

(see
note No. <a href="#note47" title="go to n&#x6f;te 47">47</a>)
here in <i>America</i>: And as
every Nation dif­fers in their Laws, Manners and Customs,
in <i>Europe</i>, <i>Asia</i> and <i>Africa</i>, so do they the very
same here; That it would be a most intricate and
laborious trouble, to run (with a description) through
the several Nations of <i>Indians</i> here in <i>America</i>, considering
the in­num­er­able­ness and di­vers­i­ties of them
that dwell on this vast and un­measured Con­ti­nent:
But rather then I’le be altogether silent, I shall do
like the Painter in the Comedy, who being to limne
out the Pour­trai­ture of the Furies, as they severally
appeared, set himself behind a Pillar, and between
fright and amazement, drew them by guess. Those
<i>Indians</i> that I have convers’d withall here in this
Province of <i>Mary-Land</i>, and have had any occular
experimental view of either of their Customs, Manners,
Religions, and Absurdities, are
called by the <span class="xxpn" id="p072">{72}</span>
name of <i>Susquehanocks</i>, being a people lookt upon by
the Christian Inhabitants, as the most Noble and
Heroick Nation of <i>Indians</i> that dwell upon the confines
of <i>America</i>; also are so allowed and lookt upon
by the rest of the <i>Indians</i>, by a submissive and tributary
acknowledgement; being a people cast into the
mould of a most large and Warlike deportment, the
men being for the most part seven foot high in latitude,
and in magnitude and bulk suitable to so high
a pitch; their voyce large and hollow, as ascending
out of a Cave, their gate and behavior strait, stately
and majestick, treading on the Earth with as much
pride, contempt, and disdain to so sordid a Center,
as can be imagined from a creature derived from the
same mould and Earth.</p>

<p>Their bodies are cloth’d with no other Armour to
defend them from the nipping frosts of a benumbing
Winter, or the penetrating and scorching influence of
the Sun in a hot Summer, then what Nature gave
them when they parted with the dark receptacle of
their mothers womb. They go Men, Women and
Children, all naked, only where shame leads them by
a natural instinct to be reservedly modest, there they
become cover’d. The formality of <i>Jezabels</i> artificial
Glory is much courted and followed by these <i>Indians</i>,
only in matter of colours (I conceive) they differ.</p>

<p>The <i>Indians</i> paint upon their faces one stroke of
red, another of green, another of white, and another
of black, so that when they
have accomplished the <span class="xxpn" id="p073">{73}</span>
Equipage of their Countenance in this trim, they are
the only Hieroglyphicks and Representatives of the
Furies. Their skins are naturally white, but altered
from their originals by the several dyings of Roots
and Barks, that they prepare and make useful to
metamorphize their hydes into a dark Cinamon brown.
The hair of their head is black, long and harsh, but
where Nature hath appointed the situation of it any
where else, they divert it (by an antient custom) from
its growth, by pulling it up hair by hair by the root
in its primitive appearance. Several of them wear
divers impressions on their breasts and armes, as the
picture of the Devil, Bears, Tigers, and Panthers,
which are imprinted on their several lineaments with
much difficulty and pain, with an irrevocable determination
of its abiding there: And this they count a
badge of Heroick Valour, and the only Ornament due
to their <i>Heroes</i>. (See
note No. <a href="#note48" title="go to n&#x6f;te 48">48</a>).</p>

<p>These <i>Susquehanock Indians</i> are for the most part
great Warriours, and seldom sleep one Summer in the
quiet armes of a peaceable Rest, but keep (by their
present Power, as well as by their former Conquest)
the several Nations of <i>Indians</i> round about them, in a
forceable obedience and subjection.</p>

<p>Their Government is wrapt up in so various and
intricate a Laborynth, that the speculativ’st Artist in
the whole World, with his artificial and natural
Opticks, cannot see into the rule or sway of these
<i>Indians</i>, to distinguish what name
of Government to <span class="xxpn" id="p074">{74}</span>
call them by; though <i>Purchas</i> (see
note No. <a href="#note49" title="go to n&#x6f;te 49">49</a>)
in
his <i>Peregrination</i> between <i>London</i> and <i>Essex</i>, (which
he calls the whole World) will undertake (forsooth)
to make a Monarchy of them, but if he had said
Anarchy, his word would have pass’d with a better
belief. All that ever I could observe in them as to
this matter is, that he that is most cruelly Valorous,
is accounted the most Noble: Here is very seldom
any creeping from a Country Farm, into a Courtly
Gallantry, by a sum of money; nor feeing the Heralds
to put Daggers and Pistols into their Armes, to make
the ignorant believe that they are lineally descended
from the house of the Wars and Conquests; he that
fights best carries it here.</p>

<p>When they determine to go upon some Design that
will and doth require a Consideration, some six of
them get into a corner, and sit in Juncto; and if
thought fit, their business is made popular, and immediately
put into action; if not, they make a full stop
to it, and are silently reserv’d.</p>

<p>The Warlike Equipage they put themselves in
when they prepare for <i>Belona’s</i> March, is with their
faces, armes, and breasts confusedly painted, their
hair greased with Bears oyl, and stuck thick with
Swans Feathers, with a wreath or Diadem of black
and white Beads upon their heads, a small Hatchet,
instead of a Cymetre, stuck in their girts behind them,
and either with Guns, or Bows and Arrows. In this
posture and dress they march out from
their Fort, or <span class="xxpn" id="p075">{75}</span>
dwelling, to the number of Forty in a Troop, singing
(or rather howling out) the Decades or Warlike
exploits of their Ancestors, ranging the wide Woods
untill their fury has met with an Enemy worthy of
their Revenge. What Prisoners fall into their hands
by the destiny of War, they treat them very civilly
while they remain with them abroad, but when they
once return homewards, they then begin to dress them
in the habit for death, putting on their heads and
armes wreaths of Beads, greazing their hair with fat,
some going before, and the rest behind, at equal distance
from their Prisoners, bellowing in a strange and
confused manner, which is a true presage and forerunner
of destruction to their then conquered Enemy. (See note
No. <a href="#note50" title="go to n&#x6f;te 50">50</a>).</p>

<p>In this manner of march they continue till they
have brought them to their Berken City (see
note No. <a href="#note51" title="go to n&#x6f;te 51">51</a>)
where they deliver them up to those that in
cruelty will execute them, without either the legal
Judgement of a Council of War, or the benefit of their
Clergy at the Common Law. The common and usual
deaths they put their Prisoners to, is to bind them to
stakes, making a fire some distance from them; then
one or other of them, whose Genius delights in the art
of Paganish dissection, with a sharp knife or flint cuts
the Cutis or outermost skin of the brow so deep, untill
their nails, or rather Talons, can fasten themselves
firm and secure in, then (with a most rigid jerk) disrobeth
the head of skin and hair at
one pull, leaving <span class="xxpn" id="p076">{76}</span>
the skull almost as bare as those Monumental Skelitons
at Chyrurgions-Hall; but for fear they should
get cold by leaving so warm and customary a Cap off,
they immediately apply to the skull a Cataplasm of
hot Embers to keep their Pericanium warm. While
they are thus acting this cruelty on their heads,
several others are preparing pieces of Iron, and barrels
of old Guns, which they make red hot, to sear each
part and lineament of their bodies, which they perform
and act in a most cruel and barbarous manner:
And while they are thus in the midst of their torments
and execrable usage, some tearing their skin
and hair of their head off by violence, others searing
their bodies with hot irons, some are cutting their
flesh off, and eating it before their eyes raw while
they are alive; yet all this and much more never
makes them lower the Top-gallant sail of their
Heroick courage, to beg with a submissive Repentance
any indulgent favour from their persecuting Enemies;
but with an undaunted contempt to their cruelty, eye
it with so slight and mean a respect, as if it were
below them to value what they did, they courageously
(while breath doth libertize them) sing the summary
of their Warlike Atchievements.</p>

<p>Now after this cruelty has brought their tormented
lives to a period, they immediately fall to butchering
of them into parts, distributing the several pieces
amongst the Sons of War, to intomb the ruines of
their deceased Conquest in no
other Sepulchre then <span class="xxpn" id="p077">{77}</span>
their unsanctified maws; which they with more appetite
and desire do eat and digest, then if the best of
foods should court their stomachs to participate of the
most restorative Banquet. Yet though they now and
then feed upon the Carkesses of their Enemies, this is
not a common dyet, but only a particular dish for the
better sort (see
note No. <a href="#note52" title="go to n&#x6f;te 52">52</a>)
for there is not a Beast
that runs in the Woods of <i>America</i>, but if they can by
any means come at him, without any scruple of Conscience
they’le fall too (Without saying Grace) with a
devouring greediness.</p>

<p>As for their Religion, together with their Rites and
Ceremonies, they are so absurd and ridiculous, that
its almost a sin to name them. They own no other
Deity than the Devil, (solid or profound) but with a
kind of a wilde imaginary conjecture, they suppose
from their groundless conceits, that the World had a
Maker, but where he is that made it, or whether he
be living to this day, they know not. The Devil, as
I said before, is all the God they own or worship;
and that more out of a slavish fear then any real
Reverence to his Infernal or Diabolical greatness, he
forcing them to their Obedience by his rough and
rigid dealing with them, often appearing visibly
among them to their terrour, bastinadoing them
(with cruel menaces) even unto death, and burning
their Fields of Corn and houses, that the relation
thereof makes them tremble themselves when they
tell it. <span class="xxpn" id="p078">{78}</span></p>

<p>Once in four years they Sacrifice a Childe to him
(see
note No. <a href="#note53" title="go to n&#x6f;te 53">53</a>)
in an acknowledgement of their
firm obedience to all his Devillish powers, and Hellish
commands. The Priests to whom they apply themselves
in matters of importance and greatest distress,
are like those that attended upon the Oracle at
<i>Delphos</i>, who by their Magic-spells could command a
<i>pro</i> or <i>con</i> from the Devil when they pleas’d. These
<i>Indians</i> oft-times raise great Tempests when they
have any weighty matter or design in hand, and by
blustering storms inquire of their Infernal God (the
Devil) <i>How matters shall go with them either in publick
or private.</i> (See
note No. <a href="#note54" title="go to n&#x6f;te 54">54</a>).</p>

<p>When any among them depart this life, they give
him no other intombment, then to set him upright
upon his breech in a hole dug in the Earth some five
foot long, and three foot deep, covered over with the
Bark of Trees Arch-wise, with his face Du-West, only
leaving a hole half a foot square open. They dress
him in the same Equipage and Gallantry that he used
to be trim’d in when he was alive, and so bury him
(if a Soldier) with his Bows, Arrows, and Target,
together with all the rest of his implements and
weapons of War, with a Kettle of Broth, and Corn
standing before him, lest he should meet with bad
quarters in his way. (See note No. <a href="#note55" title="go to n&#x6f;te 55">55</a>)
His Kinred
and Relations follow him to the Grave, sheath’d in
Bear skins for close mourning, with the tayl droyling
on the ground, in imitation of
our <i>English</i> Solemners, <span class="xxpn" id="p079">{79}</span>
that think there’s nothing like a tayl a Degree in
length, to follow the dead Corpse to the Grave with.
Here if that snuffling Prolocutor, that waits upon the
dead Monuments of the Tombs at <i>Westminster</i>, with
his white Rod were there, he might walk from Tomb
to Tomb with his, <i>Here lies the Duke of</i> Ferrara <i>and
his Dutchess</i>, and never find any decaying vacation,
unless it were in the moldering Consumption of his
own Lungs. They bury all within the wall or
Pallisado’d impalement of their City, or <i>Connadago</i>
(see
note No. <a href="#note56" title="go to n&#x6f;te 56">56</a>)
as they call it. Their houses are
low and long, built with the Bark of Trees Arch-wise,
standing thick and confusedly together. They are
situated a hundred and odd miles distant from the
Christian Plantations of <i>Mary-Land</i>, at the head of a
River that runs into the Bay of <i>Chæsapike</i>, called by
their own name <i>The Susquehanock River</i>, where they
remain and inhabit most part of the Summer time,
and seldom remove far from it, unless it be to subdue
any Forreign Rebellion.</p>

<p>About <i>November</i> the best Hunters draw off to
several remote places of the Woods, where they know
the Deer, Bear, and Elke useth; there they build them
several Cottages, which they call their Winter-quarter,
where they remain for the space of three months, untill
they have killed up a sufficiency of Provisions to supply
their Families with in the Summer.</p>

<p>The Women are the Butchers, Cooks, and Tillers
of the ground, the Men think it below
the honour of <span class="xxpn" id="p080">{80}</span>
a Masculine, to stoop to any thing but that which
their Gun, or Bow and Arrows can command. The
Men kill the several Beasts which they meet withall
in the Woods, and the Women are the Pack horses to
fetch it in upon their backs, fleying and dressing the
hydes, (as well as the flesh for provision) to make
them fit for Trading, and which are brought down to
the <i>English</i> at several seasons in the year, to truck
and dispose of them for course Blankets, Guns, Powder
and lead, Beads, small Looking-glasses, Knives,
and Razors. (See note No. <a href="#note57" title="go to n&#x6f;te 57">57</a>).</p>

<p>I never observed all the while I was amongst these
naked <i>Indians</i>, that ever the Women wore the
Breeches, or dared either in look or action predominate
over the Men. They are very constant to their
Wives; and let this be spoken to their Heathenish
praise, that did they not alter their bodies by their
dyings, paintings, and cutting themselves, marring
those Excellencies that Nature bestowed upon them
in their original conceptions and birth, there would
be as amiable beauties amongst them, as any <i>Alexandria</i>
could afford, when <i>Mark Anthony</i> and <i>Cleopatra</i>
dwelt there together. Their Marriages are
short and authentique; for after ’tis resolv’d upon by
both parties, the Woman sends her intended Husband
a Kettle of boyl’d Venison, or Bear; and he returns
in lieu thereof Beaver or Otters Skins, and so their
Nuptial Rites are concluded without other Ceremony.
(See
note No. <a href="#note58" title="go to n&#x6f;te 58">58</a>)
<span class="xxpn" id="p081">{81}</span></p>

<p>Before I bring my Heathenish Story to a period, I
have one thing worthy your observation: For as our
Grammar Rules have it, <i>Non decet quenquam me ire

Have lived with sorrow to see the Anointed of the
Lord tore from his Throne by the hands of Paricides,
and in contempt haled, in the view of God,
Angels and Men, upon a public Theatre, and there
murthered. I have seen the sacred Temple of the
Almighty, in scorn by Schismatics made the Receptacle
of Theeves and Robbers; and those Religious
Prayers, that in devotion Evening and Morning were
offered up as a Sacrifice to our God, rent by Sacrilegious
hands, and made no other use of, then sold to
Brothel-houses to light Tobacco with.</p>

<p>Who then can stay, or will, to see things of so great
weight steer’d by such barbarous Hounds as these:
First, were there an <i>Egypt</i> to go down to, I would
involve my Liberty to them, upon condition ne’er
more to see my Country. What? live in silence
under the sway of such base actions, is to give consent;
and though the lowness of my present Estate
and Condition, with the hazard I put my future dayes
upon, might plead a just excuse for me to stay at
home; but Heavens forbid: I’le
rather serve in <span class="xxpn" id="p084">{84}</span>
Chains, and draw the Plough with Animals, till death
shall stop and say, <i>It is enough</i>. Sir, if you stay
behind, I wish you well: I am bound for <i>Mary-Land</i>,
this day I have made some entrance into my intended
voyage, and when I have done more, you shall know
of it. I have here inclosed what you of me desired,
but truly trouble, discontent and business, have so
amazed my senses, that what to write, or where to
write, I conceive my self almost as uncapable as he
that never did write. What you’le find will be <i>Ex

there may want something of a flourishing stile to
dress them forth, yet I’m certain there wants nothing
of truth, will, and desire.</p>

<p class="pfirst"><span class="ddropcapbox">
<span class="fsz0 splineha">I</span></span>
Am got ashoar with much ado, and it is very well
it is as it is, for if I had stayed a little longer, I
had certainly been a Creature of the Water, for I had
hardly flesh enough to carry me to Land, not that I
wanted for any thing that the Ship could afford me in
reason: But oh the great bowls of Pease-porridge that
appeared in sight every day about the hour of twelve,
ingulfed the senses of my Appetite so, with the
restringent quality of the Salt Beef, upon the internal
Inhabitants of my belly, that a <i>Galenist</i> for some days
after my arrival, with his Bag-pipes of Physical operations,
could hardly make my Puddings dance in any
methodical order.</p>

<p>But to set by these things that happened unto me
at Sea, I am now upon Land, and there I’le keep my
self if I can, and for four years I am pretty sure of
my restraint; and had I known my yoak would have
been so easie, (as I conceive it will) I would have
been here long before now, rather then to have dwelt
under the pressure of a Rebellious and Trayterous
Government so long as I did. I dwell now by providence
in the Province of <i>Mary-Land</i>, (under the quiet
Government of the Lord <i>Baltemore</i>) which Country
a bounds in a most glorious prosperity and plenty of
all things. And though the Infancy of her situation
might plead an excuse to those several imperfections,
(if she were guilty of any of
them) which by <span class="xxpn" id="p091">{91}</span>
scandalous and imaginary conjectures are falsly laid to her
charge, and which she values with so little notice or
perceivance of discontent, that she hardly alters her
visage with a frown, to let them know she is angry
with such a Rascality of people, that loves nothing
better then their own sottish and abusive acclamations
of baseness: To be short, the Country (so far
forth as I have seen into it) is incomparable.</p>

<p>Here is a sort of naked Inhabitants, or wilde
people, that have for many ages I believe lived here
in the Woods of <i>Mary-Land</i>, as well as in other parts
of the Continent, before e’er it was by the Christian
Discoverers found out; being a people strange to
behold, as well in their looks, which by confused
paintings makes them seem dreadful, as in their
sterne and heroick gate and deportments, the Men
are mighty tall and big limbed, the Women not altogether
so large; they are most of them very well
featured, did not their wilde and ridiculous dresses
alter their original excellencies: The men are great
Warriours and Hunters, the Women ingenious and
laborious Housewives.</p>

<p>As to matter of their Worship, they own no other
Deity then the Devil, and him more out of a slavish
fear, then any real devotion, or willing ac­knowl­edge­ment
to his Hel­lish power. They live in little small
Bark-Cottages, in the remote parts of the Woods,
kil­ling and slay­ing the several Animals that they
meet withall to make provision
of, dressing their <span class="xxpn" id="p092">{92}</span>
several Hydes and Skins to Trafique withall, when a
con­ven­iency of Trade pre­sents. I would go on further,
but like Doctor <i>Case</i>, when he had not a word

Earth, and your glorious and everlasting happiness in
the World to Come. <span class="xxpn" id="p093">{93}</span></p>

<p>These lines (my dear Parents) come from that Son
which by an irregular Fate was removed from his
Native home, and after a five months dangerous passage,
was landed on the remote Continent of <i>America</i>,
in the Province of <i>Mary-Land</i>, where now by providence
I reside. To give you the particulars of the
several accidents that happened in our voyage by
Sea, it would swell a Journal of some sheets, and
therefore too large and tedious for a Letter: I think
it therefore necessary to bind up the relation in
Octavo, and give it you in short.</p>

<p>We had a blowing and dangerous passage of it, and
for some dayes after I arrived, I was an absolute
<i>Copernicus</i>, it being one main point of my moral
Creed, to believe the World had a pair of long legs,
and walked with the burthen of the Creation upon
her back. For to tell you the very truth of it, for
some dayes upon Land, after so long and tossing a
passage, I was so giddy that I could hardly tread an
even step; so that all things both above and below
(that was in view) appeared to me like the <i>Kentish
Britains</i> to <i>William the Conqueror</i>, in a moving
posture.</p>

<p>Those few number of weeks since my arrival, has
given me but little experience to write any thing
large of the Country; only thus much I can say, and
that not from any imaginary conjectures, but from an
occular observation, That this Country of <i>Mary-Land</i>
abounds in a flourishing variety
of delightful Woods, <span class="xxpn" id="p094">{94}</span>
pleasant groves, lovely Springs, together with spacious
Navigable Rivers and Creeks, it being a most helthful
and pleasant situation, so far as my knowledge has
yet had any view in it.</p>

<p>Herds of Deer are as numerous in this Province of
<i>Mary-Land</i>, as Cuckolds can be in <i>London</i>, only their
horns are not so well drest and tipt with silver as
theirs are.</p>

<p>Here if the Devil had such a Vagary in his head as
he had once among the <i>Gadareans</i>, he might drown
a thousand head of Hogs and they’d ne’re be miss’d,
for the very Woods of this Province swarms with
them.</p>

<p>The Christian Inhabitant of this Province, as to the
general, lives wonderful well and contented: The
Government of this Province is by the loyalness of
the people, and loving demeanor of the Proprietor
and Governor of the same, kept in a continued peace
and unity.</p>

<p>The Servant of this Province, which are stigmatiz’d
for Slaves by the clappermouth jaws of the vulgar in
<i>England</i>, live more like Freemen then the most
Mechanick Apprentices in <i>London</i>, wanting for
nothing that is convenient and necessary, and according
to their several capacities, are extraordinary well
used and respected. So leaving things here as I
found them, and lest I should commit Sacriledge
upon your more serious meditations, with the Tautologies
of a long-winded Letter, I’le
subscribe with a <span class="xxpn" id="p095">{95}</span>
heavenly Ejaculation to the God of Mercy to preserve
you now and for evermore, <i>Amen</i>.</p>

let me beg to give you this advice in it; That the
Factor whom you imploy be a man of a Brain, otherwise
the Planter will go near to make a Skimming-dish
of his Skull: I know your Genius can interpret
my meaning. The people of this place (whether the
saltness of the Ocean gave them any alteration when
they went over first, or their
continual dwelling under <span class="xxpn" id="p096">{96}</span>
the remote Clyme where they now inhabit, I know
not) are a more acute people in general, in matters of
Trade and Commerce, then in any other place of the
World (see
note No. <a href="#note60" title="go to n&#x6f;te 60">60</a>)
and by their crafty and sure
bargaining, do often over-reach the raw and unexperienced
Merchant. To be short, he that undertakes
Merchants imployment for <i>Mary-Land</i>, must have
more of Knave in him then Fool; he must not be a
windling piece of Formality, that will lose his Imployers
Goods for Conscience sake; nor a flashy piece
of Prodigality, that will give his Merchants fine
Hollands, Laces, and Silks, to purchase the benevolence
of a Female: But he must be a man of solid
confidence, carrying alwayes in his looks the Effigies
of an Execution upon Command, if he supposes a
baffle or denyal of payment, where a debt for his
Imployer is legally due. (See note No.
<a href="#note61" title="go to n&#x6f;te 61">61</a>).</p>

<p><i>Sir</i>, I had like almost to forgot to tell you in what

the variety and diversity of all that is or may be rare. But lest I
should Tantalize you with a relation of that which is very unlikely
of your enjoying, by reason of that strong Antipathy you have ever
had ’gainst Travel, as to your own particular: I’le only tell you,
that <i>Mary-Land</i> is seated within the large extending armes <span

a twofold unmeasurable joy I received
your Letter: First, in the consideration of
Gods great Mercy to you in particular, (though weak
and aged) yet to give you dayes among the living.
Next, that his now most Excellent Majesty <i>Charles</i>
the Second, is by the omnipotent Providence of God,
seated in the Throne of his Father. I hope that God
has placed him there, will give him a heart to praise
and magnifie his name for ever, and a hand of just
Revenge, to punish the murthering and rebellious
Outrages of those Sons of shame and Apostacy, that
Usurped the Throne of his Sacred Honour. Near
about the time I received your Letter, (or a little
before) here sprang up in this Province of <i>Mary-Land</i>
a kind of pigmie Rebellion:
A company of <span class="xxpn" id="p099">{99}</span>
weak-witted men, which thought to have traced the steps
of <i>Oliver</i> in Rebellion (see
note No. <a href="#note63" title="go to n&#x6f;te 63">63</a>). They
began to be mighty stiff and hidebound in their proceedings,
clothing themselves with the flashy pretences
of future and imaginary honour, and (had they
not been suddenly quell’d) they might have done so
much mischief (for aught I know) that nothing but
utter ruine could have ransomed their headlong follies.</p>

<p>His Majesty appearing in <i>England</i>, he quickly (by
the splendor of his Rayes) thawed the stiffness of
their frozen and slippery intentions. All things
(blessed be God for it) are at peace and unity here
now: And as <i>Luther</i> being asked once, What he
thought of some small Opinions that started up in his
time? answered, <i>That he thought them to be good honest
people, exempting their error</i>: So I judge of these men,
That their thoughts were not so bad at first, as their
actions would have led them into in process of time.</p>

<p>I have here enclosed sent you something written in
haste upon the Kings coming to the enjoyment of his
Throne, with a reflection upon the former sad and
bad times; I have done them as well as I could, considering
all things: If they are not so well as they
should be, all I can do is to wish them better for your
sakes. My Obedience to you and my Mother alwayes
devoted.</p>

<p>The Antimonial Cup (dear Cosen) you sent me, I
had; and as soon as I received it, I went to work
with the Infirmities and Diseases of my body. At
the first draught, it made such havock among the
several humors that had stolen into my body, that
like a Conjurer in a room among a company of little
Devils, they no sooner hear him begin to speak high
words, but away they pack, and happy is he that can
get out first, some up the Chimney, and the rest down
stairs, till they are all disperst. So those malignant
humors of my body, feeling the operative power, and
medicinal virtue of this Cup, were so amazed at their
sudden surprizal, (being alwayes before battered only
by the weak assaults of some few Empyricks) they
stood not long to dispute, but
with joynt consent <span class="xxpn" id="p101">{101}</span>
made their retreat, some running through the sink of
the Skullery, the rest climbing up my ribs, took my
mouth for a Garret-window, and so leapt out.</p>

me this medicinal vertue, I return you my thanks:
It came in a very good time, when I was dangerously
sick, and by the assistance of God it hath perfectly

that have (contrary to my expectation) crouded into

of my brain were a sleep. Where they got in I
know not, but to my grief and terror I find them

<p>My good Parents, God hath done marvellous things
for me, far beyond my deserts, which at best were
preposterously sinful, and unsuitable to the sacred
will of an Almighty: <i>But he is merciful, and his mercy
endures for ever.</i> When sinful man has by his Evils
and Iniquities pull’d some penetrating Judgment upon
his head, and finding himself immediately not able to
stand under so great a burthen as Gods smallest
stroke of Justice, lowers the Top-gallant sayle of his
Pride, and with an humble submissiveness prostrates
himself before the Throne of his
sacred Mercy, and <span class="xxpn" id="p107">{107}</span>
like those three Lepars that sate at the Gate of
<i>Samaria</i>, resolved, <i>If we go into the City we shall perish,
and if we stay here we shall perish also: Therefore we
will throw our selves into the hands of the</i> Assyrians <i>and
if we perish, we perish</i>: This was just my condition as
to eternal state; my soul was at a stand in this black
storm of affliction: I view’d the World, and all that’s
pleasure in her, and found her altogether flashy, aiery,
and full of notional pretensions, and not one firm
place where a distressed Soul could hang his trust on.
Next I viewed my self, and there I found, instead of
good Works, lively Faith, and Charity, a most horrid
neast of condemned Evils, bearing a supreme Prerogative
over my internal faculties. You’l say here
was little hope of rest in this extreme Eclipse, being
in a desperate amaze to see my estate so deplorable:
My better Angel urged me to deliver up my aggrievances
to the Bench of Gods Mercy, the sure support
of all distressed Souls: His Heavenly warning, and
inward whispers of the good Spirit I was resolv’d to
entertain, and not quench, and throw my self into the
armes of a loving God, <i>If I perish, I perish</i>. ’Tis
beyond wonder to think of the love of God extended
to sinful man, that in the deepest distresses or agonies
of Affliction, when all other things prove rather
hinderances then advantages, even at that time God
is ready and steps forth to the supportment of his
drooping Spirit. Truly, about a fortnight before I
wrote this Letter, two of
our ablest Physicians <span class="xxpn" id="p108">{108}</span>
rendered me up into the hands of God, the universal
Doctor of the whole World, and subscribed with a
silent acknowledgement, That all their Arts, screw’d
up to the very Zenith of Scholastique perfection, were
not capable of keeping me from the Grave at that
time: But God, the great preserver of Soul and Body,
said contrary to the expectation of humane reason,
<i>Arise, take up thy bed and walk</i>.</p>

<p>I am now (through the help of my Maker) creeping
up to my former strength and vigour, and every day
I live, I hope I shall, through the assistance of divine
Grace, climbe nearer and nearer to my eternal home.</p>

<p>After having resolved to reprint Alsop’s early account of Maryland, as an
addition to my <i>Bibliotheca Americana</i>, I immediately fell in with a difficulty
which I had not counted on. After much inquiry and investigation, I could
find no copy to print from among all my earnest book collecting acquaintances.
At length some one informed me that Mr. Bancroft the historian
had a copy in his library. I immediately took the liberty of calling on him
and making known my wants, he generously offered to let me have the
use of it for the purpose stated, I carried the book home, had it carefully
copied, but unfortunately during the process I discovered the text was
imperfect as well as deficient in both portrait and map. Like Sisyphus I
had to begin anew, and do nearly all my labor over; I sent to London to
learn if the functionaries in the British Museum would permit a tracing of
the portrait and map to be made from their copy, the answer returned was,
that they would or could not permit this, but I might perfect my text if I
so choosed by copying from theirs. Here I was once more at sea without
compass, rudder, or chart: I made known my condition to an eminent and
judicious collector of old American literature in the city of New York, he
very frankly informed me that he could aid me in my difficulty by letting
me have the use of a copy, which would relieve me from my present
dilemma. I was greatly rejoiced at this discovery as well as by the generosity
of the owner. The following day the book was put into my possession,
and so by the aid of it was enabled to complete the text. Here another
difficulty burst into view, this copy had no portrait. That being the only
defect in perfecting a copy of Alsop’s book, I now resolved to proceed and
publish it without a portrait, but perhaps fortunately, making known this
resolve to some of the knowing ones in book gathering, they remonstrated
against this course, adding that it would ruin the book in the estimation of
all who would buy such a rarity. I was inclined to listen favorably to this
protest, and therefore had to commence a new effort to obtain a portrait.
I then laid about me again to try and procure a copy that had one: I knew
that not more than three or four collectors in the country who were likely
to have such an heir-loom. To one living at a considerable distance from
New York I took the liberty of addressing a letter on the subject, wherein I
made known my difficulties. To my great gratification this courteous and
confiding gentleman not only immediately made answer, but sent a perfect
copy of this rare and much wanted book for my use. I
immediately had the <span class="xxpn" id="p110">{110}</span>
portrait and map reproduced by the photo-lithographic process. During
the time the book was in my possession, which was about ten days, so
fearful was I that any harm should befall it that I took the precaution to
wrap up the precious little volume in tissue paper and carry it about with
me all the time in my side pocket, well knowing that if it was either injured
or lost I could not replace it. I understand that a perfect copy of the
original in the London market would bring fifty pounds sterling. I had
the satisfaction to learn it reached the generous owner in safety.</p>

<p>Had I known the difficulties I had to encounter of procuring a copy of
the original of Alsop’s singular performance, I most certainly would never
have undertaken to reproduce it in America. Mr. Jared Sparks told me
that he had a like difficulty to encounter when he undertook to write the
life of Ledyard the traveler. Said he: “a copy of his journal I could find
nowhere to purchase, at length I was compelled to borrow a copy on very
humiliating conditions; the owner perhaps valued it too highly.” I may
add that I had nearly as much difficulty in securing an editor, as I had in procuring
a perfect copy. However on this point I at last was very fortunate.</p>

<p>Cecilius, Lord Baltimore, eldest son of George Calvert, 1st Lord Baltimore,
and Anne Wynne of Hertingfordbury, England, was born in 1606. He
succeeded to the title April 15, 1632, and married Anne, daughter of Lord
Arundel, whose name was given to a county in Maryland. His rule over
Maryland, disturbed in Cromwell’s time, but restored under Charles II, has
always been extolled. He died Nov. 30, 1675, covered with age and

<p>Owen Feltham, as our author in his errata correctly gives the name, was
an author who enjoyed a great reputation in his day. His <i>Resolves</i> appeared
first about 1620, and in 1696 had reached the eleventh edition. They were
once reprinted in the 18th century, and in full or in part four
times in the <span class="xxpn" id="p111">{111}</span>

<p>The fifth monarchy men were a set of religionists who arose during the
Puritan rule in England. They believed in a fifth universal monarchy of
which Christ was to be the head, under whom they, his saints, were to
possess the earth. In 1660 they caused an outbreak in London, in which
many were killed and others tried and executed. Their leader was one
Venner. The Adamites, a gnostic sect, who pretended that regenerated
man should go naked like Adam and Eve in their state of innocence, were
revived during the Puritan rule in England; and in our time in December,
1867, we have seen the same theory held and practiced in Newark, N. J.</p>

<p>In the provisional act, passed in the first assembly, March 19, 1638, and
entitled “An Act ordaining certain laws for the government of this province,”
the twelfth section required that “every person planting tobacco
shall plant and tend two acres of corn.” A special act was introduced the
same session and read twice, but not passed. A new law was passed, however,
Oct. 23, 1640, renewed Aug. 1, 1642, April 21, 1649, Oct. 20, 1654,
April 12, 1662, and made perpetual in 1676. These acts imposed a fine of
fifty pounds of tobacco for every half acre the offender fell short, besides
fifty pounds of the same current leaf as constables’ fees. It was to this
persistent enforcement of the cultivation of cereals that Maryland so soon
became the granary of New England. <span class="xxpn" id="p114">{114}</span></p>

<p>The Assembly, or House of Burgesses, at first consisted of all freemen, but
they gradually gave place to delegates. The influence of the proprietary,
however, decided the selection. In 1650 fourteen burgesses met as delegates
or representatives of the several hundreds, there being but two
counties organized, St. Marys and the Isle of Kent. Ann Arundel, called
at times Providence county, was erected April 29, 1650. Patuxent was

<p>The <span class="spwrdspc1">Susquehannas. This</span>
<i>Relation</i> is one of the most valuable portions
of Alsop’s tract, as no other Maryland document gives as much concerning
this tribe, which nevertheless figures extensively in Maryland annals.
Dutch and Swedish writers speak of a tribe called Minquas (Minquosy,
Machœretini in <i>De Laet</i>, p. 76); the French in Canada (<i>Champlain</i>, the
<i>Jesuit Relations, Gendron, Particularitez du Pays des Hurons</i>, p. 7, etc.),
make frequent allusion to the Gandastogués (more briefly Andastés), a tribe
friendly to their allies the Hurons, and sturdy enemies of the Iroquois;
later still Pennsylvania writers speak of the Conestogas, the tribe to which
Logan belonged, and the tribe which perished at the hands of the Paxton
boys. Although Gallatin in his map, followed by Bancroft, placed the
Andastés near Lake Erie, my researches led me to correct this, and identify
the Susquehannas, Minqua, Andastés or Gandastogués and Conestogas as
being all the same tribe, the first name being apparently an appellation
given them by the Virginia tribes; the second that given them by the
Algonquins on the Delaware; while Gandastogué as the French, or Conestoga
as the English wrote it, was their own tribal name, meaning cabin-pole
men, <i>Natio Perticarum</i>, from Andasta, a cabin-pole (map in Creuxius,
<i>Historia Canadensis</i>). I forwarded a paper on the subject to Mr. Schoolcraft,
for insertion in the government work issuing under his supervision.
It was inserted in the last volume without my name, and ostensibly as Mr.
Schoolcraft’s. I then gave it with my name in the <i>Historical Magazine</i>,
vol.
<span class="smmaj">II</span>, p. 294. The result arrived at there has been accepted by Bancroft,
in his large paper edition, by Parkman, in his <i>Jesuits in the Wilderness</i>, by
Dr. O’Callaghan, S. F. Streeter, Esq., of the Maryland Historical Society,
and students generally. <span class="xxpn" id="p118">{118}</span></p>

<p>From the Virginian, Dutch, Swedish and French authorities, we can thus
give their history briefly.</p>

<p>The territory now called Canada, and most of the northern portion of the
United States, from Lake Superior and the Mississippi to the mouth of the
St. Lawrence and Chesapeake bay were, when dis­cov­ered by Euro­peans,
occupied by two families of tribes, the Algonquin and the Huron Iroquois.
The former which included all the New England tribes, the Micmacs, Mohegans,
Delawares, Illinois, Chippewas, Ottawas, Pot­ta­wat­a­mies, Sacs, Foxes,
Miamis, and many of the Maryland and Virginian tribes sur­rounded the
more powerful and civilized tribes who have been called Huron Iroquois,
from the names of the two most powerful nations of the group, the Hurons
or Wyandots of Upper Canada, and the Iroquois or Five Nations of New
York. Besides these the group included the Neuters on the Niagara, the
Dinondadies in Upper Canada, the Eries south of the lake of that name,
the Andastogués or Susquehannas on that river, the Nottaways and some
other Virginian tribes, and finally the Tuscaroras in North Carolina and
perhaps the Cherokees, whose language presents many striking points of
similarity.</p>

<p>Both these groups of tribes claimed a western origin, and seem, in their
progress east, to have driven out of Ohio the Quappas, called by the
Algonquins, Alkansas or Allegewi, who retreated down the Ohio and
Mississippi to the district which has preserved the name given them by the
Algonquins.</p>

<p>After planting themselves on the Atlantic border, the various tribes
seem to have soon divided and become embroiled in war. The Iroquois, at
first inferior to the Algonquins were driven out of the valley of the St.
Lawrence into the lake region of New York, where by greater cultivation,
valor and union they soon became superior to the Algonquins of Canada
and New York, as the Susquehannas who settled on the Susquehanna did
over the tribes in New Jersey, Maryland and Virginia. (<i>Du Ponceau’s
Campanius</i>, p. 158.) Prior to 1600 the Susquehannas and the Mohawks,
the most eastern Iroquois tribe, came into collision, and the Susquehannas
nearly exterminated the Mohawks in a war which lasted ten years. (<i>Relation
de la Nouv. France</i>, 1659–60, p. 28.)</p>

<p>In 1608 Captain Smith, in exploring the Chesapeake and its tributaries,
met a party of sixty of these Sasquesahanocks as he calls them
(<span class="smmaj">I</span>, p. 120–1),
and he states that they were still at war with the Massawomekes or
Mohawks. (<i>De Laet Novus Orbis</i>, p. 79.)</p>

<p>DeVries, in his <i>Voyages</i> (Murphy’s translation, p. 41–3), found them in
1633 at war with the Armewamen and Sankiekans, Algonquin tribes on the
Delaware, maintaining their supremacy by butchery. They were friendly
to the Dutch. When the Swedes in 1638 settled on the Delaware, they
renewed the friendly intercourse begun by the Dutch. They purchased
lands of the ruling tribe and thus secured their friendship. (<i>Hazard’s
Annals</i>, p. 48). They carried the terror of their arms
southward also, and <span class="xxpn" id="p119">{119}</span>
in 1634 to 1644 they waged war on the Yaomacoes, the Piscataways and
Patuxents (<i>Bozman’s Maryland</i>,
<span class="smmaj">II</span>. p. 161), and were so troublesome that in
1642 Governor Calvert, by proclamation, declared them public enemies.</p>

<p>When the Hurons in Upper Canada in 1647 began to sink under the
fearful blows dealt by the Five Nations, the Susquehannas sent an
embassy to offer them aid against the common enemy. (<i>Gendron,
Quelques Particularitez du Pays des Hurons</i>, p. 7). Nor was the
offer one of little value, for the Susquehannas could put in the
field 1,300 warriors (<i>Relation de la Nouvelle France</i>, 1647–8,
p. 58) trained to the use of fire arms and European modes of war
by three Swedish soldiers whom they had obtained to instruct them.
(<i>Proud’s Pennsylvania</i>,
<span class="smmaj">I</span>, p. 111; <i>Bozman’s Maryland</i>,
<span class="smmaj">II</span>, p. 273.) Before interposing in the war, they began
by negotiation, and sent an embassy to Onondaga to urge the cantons to
peace. (<i>Relation</i>, 1648, p. 58). The Iroquois refused, and the Hurons,
sunk in apathy, took no active steps to secure the aid of the friendly
Susquehannas.</p>

<p>That tribe, however, maintained its friendly intercourse with its European
neighbors, and in 1652 Sawahegeh, Auroghteregh, Scarhuhadigh, Rutchogah
and Nathheldianeh, in presence of a Swedish deputy, ceded to Maryland
all the territory from the Patuxent river to Palmer’s island, and from the
Choptauk to the northeast branch north of Elk river. (<i>Bozman’s Maryland</i>,
<span class="smmaj">II</span>, p. 683).</p>

<p>Four years later the Iroquois, grown insolent by their success in almost
annihilating their kindred tribes north and south of Lake Erie, the Wyandots,
Dinondadies, Neuters and Eries, provoked a war with the Susquehannas,
plundering their hunters on Lake Ontario. (<i>Relation de la Nouvelle
France</i>, 1657, pp. 11, 18).</p>

<p>It was at this important period in their history that Alsop knew and
described them to us.</p>

<p>In 1661 the small-pox, that scourge of the native tribes, broke out in their
town, sweeping off many and enfeebling the nation terribly. War had
now begun in earnest with the Five Nations; and though the Susquehannas
had some of their people killed near their town (<i>Hazard’s Annals</i>, 341–7),
they in turn pressed the Cayugas so hard that some of them retreated
across Lake Ontario to Canada (<i>Relation de la Nouvelle France</i>, 1661, p. 39,
1668, p. 20). They also kept the Senecas in such alarm that they no longer
ventured to carry their peltries to New York, except in caravans escorted
by six hundred men, who even took a most circuitous route. (<i>Relation</i>, 1661,
p. 40). A law of Maryland passed May 1, 1661, authorized the governor to
aid the Susquehannas.</p>

<p>Smarting under constant defeat, the Five Nations solicited French aid
(<i>Relation de la Nouvelle France</i>, 1662–3, p. 11, 1663–4, p. 33;
<i>Charlevoix</i>,
<span class="smmaj">II</span>,
p. 134), but in April, 1663, the Western cantons raised an army of eight
hundred men to invest and storm the fort of the Susquehannas. They
embarked on Lake Ontario, according to the French account, and then went
overland to the Susquehanna. On reaching the fort,
however, they found <span class="xxpn" id="p120">{120}</span>
it well defended on the river side, and on the land side with two bastions in
European style with cannon mounted and connected by a double curtain of
large trees. After some trifling skirmishes the Iroquois had recourse to
stratagem. They sent in a party of twenty-five men to treat of peace and
ask provisions to enable them to return. The Susquehannas admitted them,
but immediately burned them all alive before the eyes of their countrymen.
(<i>Relation de la Nouvelle France</i>, 1663, p. 10). The Pennsylvania writers,
(<i>Hazard’s Annals of Pennsylvania</i>, p. 346) make the Iroquois force one
thousand six hundred, and that of the Susquehannas only one hundred.
They add that when the Iroquois retreated, the Susquehannas pursued
them, killing ten and taking as many.</p>

<p>After this the war was carried on in small parties, and Susquehanna
prisoners were from time to time burned at Oneida, Onondaga, Seneca and
Cayuga (<i>Relations de la Nouvelle France</i>, 1668 to 1673), and their prisoners
doubtless at Canoge on the Susquehanna. In the fall of 1669 the Susquehannas,
after defeating the Cayugas, offered peace, but the Cayugas put
their ambassador and his nephew to death, after retaining him five or six
months; the Oneidas having taken nine Susquehannas and sent some to
Cayuga, with forty wampum belts to maintain the war. (<i>Relation de la
Nouvelle France</i>, 1670, p. 68.)</p>

<p>At this time the great war chief of the Susquehannas was one styled
Hochitagete or Barefoot (<i>Relation de la Nouvelle France</i>, 1670, p. 47); and
raving women and crafty medicine men deluded the Iroquois with promises
of his capture and execution at the stake (<i>Relation</i>, 1670, p. 47), and a
famous medicine man of Oneida appeared after death to order his body to
be taken up and interred on the trail leading to the Susquehannas as the
only means of saving that canton from ruin. (<i>Relation</i>, 1672, p. 20.)</p>

<p>Towards the summer of 1672 a body of forty Cayugas descended the
Susquehanna in canoes, and twenty Senecas went by land to attack the
Susquehannas in their fields; but a band of sixty Andasté or Susquehanna
boys, the oldest not over sixteen, attacked the Senecas, and routed them,
killing one brave and taking another. Flushed with victory they pushed
on to attack the Cayugas, and defeated them also, killing eight and wounding
with arrow, knife and hatchet, fifteen or sixteen more, losing, however,
fifteen or sixteen of their gallant band. (<i>Relation</i>, 1672, p. 24.)</p>

<p>At this time the Susquehannas or Andastés were so reduced by war and
pestilence that they could muster only three hundred warriors. In 1675,
however, the Susquehannas were completely overthrown (<i>Etat Present</i>,
1675, manuscript; <i>Relation</i>, 1676, p. 2; <i>Relations Inédites</i>,
<span class="smmaj">II</span>, p. 44; <i>Colden’s Five Nations</i>,
<span class="smmaj">I</span>, p. 126),
but unfortunately we have no details whatever as to the forces which
effected it, or the time or manner of their utter defeat.</p>

<p>A party of about one hundred retreated into Maryland, and occupied
some abandoned Indian forts. Accused of the murder of some settlers,
apparently slain by the Senecas, they sent five of their chiefs to the Maryland
and Virginia troops, under Washington and Brent, who
went out in <span class="xxpn" id="p121">{121}</span>
pursuit. Although coming as deputies, and showing the Baltimore medal
and certificate of friendship, these chiefs were cruelly put to death. The
enraged Susquehannas then began a terrible border war, which was kept
till their utter destruction (S. F. Streeter’s Destruction of the Susquehannas,
<i>Historical Magazine</i>,
<span class="smmaj">I</span>, p. 65). The rest of the tribe, after making overtures
to Lord Baltimore, submitted to the Five Nations, and were allowed to
retain their ancient grounds. When Pennsylvania was settled, they became
known as Conestogas, and were always friendly to the colonists of Penn, as
they had been to the Dutch and Swedes. In 1701 Canoodagtoh, their king,
made a treaty with Penn, and in the document they are styled Minquas,
Conestogos or Susquehannas. They appear as a tribe in a treaty in 1742,
but were dwindling away. In 1763 the feeble remnant of the tribe became
involved in the general suspicion entertained by the colonists against the
red men, arising out of massacres on the borders. To escape danger the
poor creatures took refuge in Lancaster jail, and here they were all
butchered by the Paxton boys, who burst into the place. Parkman in his
<i>Conspiracy of Pontiac</i>, p. 414, details the sad story.</p>

<p>The last interest of this unfortunate tribe centres in Logan, the friend of
the white man, whose speech is so familiar to all, that we must regret that
it has not sustained the historical scrutiny of Brantz Mayer (<i>Tahgahjute;
or, Logan and Capt. Michael Cresap</i>, Maryland Hist. Soc., May, 1851; and
8vo, Albany, 1867). Logan was a Conestoga, in other words a Susquehanna.</p>

<p>The language of the Susquehannas, as Smith remarks, differed from that
of the Virginian tribes generally. As already stated, it was one of the
dialects of the Huron-Iroquois, and its relation to other members of the
family may be seen by the following table of the numerals:</p>

<p>Smith thus describes them: “Sixty of those Sasquesahanocks came to vs
with skins, Bowes, Arrows, Targets, Beads, swords and Tobacco pipes for
presents. Such great and well proportioned men are seldome seene, for
they seemed like Giants to the English; yea and to the neighbours, yet
seemed of an honest and simple disposition, with much adoe restrained
from adoring vs as Gods. Those are the strangest people of all those
Countries, both in language and attire; for their language it may well
beseeme their proportions, sounding from them as a voyce in a vault.
Their attire is the skinnes of Beares, and Woolues, some have Cassacks
made of Beares heads and skinnes, that a mans head goes through the
skinnes neck, and the eares of the Beare fastened to his shoulders, the nose
and teeth hanging downe his breast, another Beares face split behind him,
and at the end of the Nose hung a Pawe, the halfe sleeues comming to the
elbowes were the neckes of Beares and the armes through the mouth with
the pawes hanging at their noses. One had the head of a Wolfe hanging
in a chaine for a Iewell, his tobacco pipe three-quarters of a yard long,
prettily carued with a Bird, a Deere or some such devise at the great end,
sufficient to beat out ones braines; with Bowes, Arrowes and Clubs, suitable
to their greatnesse. They are scarce known to Powhatan. They can
make near 600 able men, and are palisadoed in their Townes to defend
them from the Massawomekes, their mortal enemies. Five of their chief
Werowances came aboord vs and crossed the Bay in their Barge. The
picture of the greatest of them is signified in the Mappe. The calfe of
whose leg was three-quarters of a yard about, and all the rest of his limbes
so answerable to that proportion, that he seemed the goodliest man we ever
beheld. His hayre, the one side was long, the other shore close with a
ridge over his crowue like a cocks combe. His arrowes were five-quarters
long, headed with the splinters of a White christall-like stone, in form of a
heart, an inch broad, and an inch and a halfe or more long. These he wore
in a Woolues skinne at his backe for his quiver, his bow in one hand and
his club in the other, as described.”—<i>Smith’s Voyages</i> (Am. ed.),
<span class="smmaj">I</span>, p. 119–20.
Tattooing referred to by our author, was an ancient Egyptian custom, and
is still retained by the women. See <i>Lane’s Modern Egyptians</i>, etc. It was
forbidden to the Jews in <i>Leviticus</i>, 19:&#x202f;28.</p>

<p>Smith thus locates their town: “The Sasquesahannocks inhabit vpon the
cheefe spring of these foure branches of the Bayes head, one day’s journey
higher than our barge could passe for rocks,” vol.
<span class="smmaj">I</span>, p. 182. Campanius
thus describes their town, which he represents as twelve miles from New
Sweden: “They live on a high mountain, very steep and difficult to climb;
there they have a fort or square building, surrounded with palisades. There
they have guns and small iron cannon, with which they shoot and defend
themselves, and take with them when they go to war.”—<i>Campanius’s Nye
Sverige</i>, p. 181; Du Ponceau’s translation, p. 158. A view of a Sasquesahannock
town is given in <i>Montanus, De Nieuwe en Onbekende Weereld</i>
(1671), p. 136, based evidently on Smith. De Lisle’s Map, dated June, 1718,
lays down Canoge, Fort des Indiens Andastés ou Susquehanocs at about
40° N.; but I find the name nowhere else.</p>

<h3 class="h3note" id="note52"><i>Note</i> 52, <i>page</i>
<a href="#p077" title="go to &#x70;. 77">77</a>.</h3>

<p>Scalping was practiced by the Scythians. (<i>Herodotus</i>, book
<span class="smmaj">IV</span>, and in the
second book of <i>Macchabees</i>,
<span class="smmaj">VII,</span> 4, 7). Antiochus is said to have caused two
of the seven Macchabee brothers to be scalped. “The skin of the head with
the hairs being drawn off.” The torture of prisoners as here described
originated with the Iroquois, and spread to nearly all the North American
tribes. It was this that led the Algonquins to give the Iroquois tribes the
names Magoué, Nadoué or Nottaway, which signified cruel. <i>Lafitau,
Moeurs des Sauvages</i>,
<span class="smmaj">II</span>, p. 287.</p>

<h3 class="h3note" id="note53"><i>Note</i> 53, <i>page</i>
<a href="#p078" title="go to &#x70;. 78">78</a>.</h3>

<p>The remarks here as to religion are vague. The Iroquois and Hurons
recognized Aireskoi or Agreskoe, as the great deity, styling him also
Teharonhiawagon. As to the Hurons, see <i>Sagard, Histoire du Canada</i>,
p. 485. The sacrifice of a child, as noted by Alsop, was unknown in the
other tribes of this race, and is not mentioned by Campanius in regard to
this one. <span class="xxpn" id="p124">{124}</span></p>

<p>The priests were the medicine men in all probability; no author mentioning
any class that can be regarded properly as priests.</p>

<p>The burial rites here described resemble those of the Iroquois (<i>Lafitau,
Moeurs des Sauvages</i>,
<span class="smmaj">II</span>, pp. 389, 407) and of the Hurons, as described by
Sagard (<i>Histoire du Canada</i>, p. 702) in the manner of placing the dead
body in a sitting posture; but there it was wrapped in furs, encased in bark
and set upon a scaffold till the feast of the dead.</p>

<p>Sagard, in his <i>Huron Dictionary</i>, gives village, <i>andata</i>; he is in
the fort or village, <i>andatagon</i>; which is equivalent to <i>Connadago</i>,
<i>nd</i> and <i>nn</i> being frequently used for each other.</p>

<p>Among the Iroquois the husband elect went to the wife’s cabin and sat
down on the mat opposite the fire. If she accepted him she presented him
a bowl of hominy and sat down beside him, turning modestly away. He
then ate some and soon after retired.—<i>Lafitau, Moeurs des Sauvages</i>,

<p>Sagard, in his <i>Histoire du Canada</i>, p. 185, makes a similar remark as to
the Hurons, a kindred tribe, men and women acting as here stated, and he
says that in this they resembled the ancient Egyptians. Compare <i>Hennepin,
Moeurs des Sauvages</i>, p. 54; <i>Description d’un Pays plus grand que

<p>The rebellion in Maryland, twice alluded to by our author in his
letters, was a very trifling matter. On the restoration of Charles II,
Lord Baltimore sent over his brother Philip Calvert as governor, with
authority to proceed against Governor Fendall, who, false alike to all
parties, was now scheming to overthrow the proprietary government. The
new governor was instructed on no account to permit Fendall to escape
with his life; but Philip Calvert was more clement than Lord Baltimore,
and though Fendall made a fruitless effort to excite the people to
opposition, he was, on his voluntary submission, punished by a merely
short imprisonment. This clemency he repaid by a subsequent attempt
to excite a rebellion.—<i>McMahon’s History of Maryland</i>, pp. 213–14,
citing Council Proceedings from 1656 to 1668, liber H. H., 74 to 82.</p>

1.B. "Project Gutenberg" is a registered trademark. It may only be
used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement. There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement. See

States. If an individual work is unprotected by copyright law in the
United States and you are located in the United States, we do not
claim a right to prevent you from copying, distributing, performing,
displaying or creating derivative works based on the work as long as
all references to Project Gutenberg are removed. Of course, we hope
that you will support the Project Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting
free access to electronic works by freely sharing Project Gutenberg-tm
works in compliance with the terms of this agreement for keeping the
Project Gutenberg-tm name associated with the work. You can easily
comply with the terms of this agreement by keeping this work in the
same format with its attached full Project Gutenberg-tm License when

  you in writing (or by e-mail) within 30 days of receipt that s/he
  does not agree to the terms of the full Project Gutenberg-tm
  License. You must require such a user to return or destroy all
  copies of the works possessed in a physical medium and discontinue
  all use of and all access to other copies of Project Gutenberg-tm
  works.

1.F.

1.F.1. Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
works not protected by U.S. copyright law in creating the Project
Gutenberg-tm collection. Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may
contain "Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate
or corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other
intellectual property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or
other medium, a computer virus, or computer codes that damage or
cannot be read by your equipment.

1.F.2. LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees. YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH 1.F.3. YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE

received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium
with your written explanation. The person or entity that provided you
with the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in
lieu of a refund. If you received the work electronically, the person
or entity providing it to you may choose to give you a second
opportunity to receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund. If
the second copy is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing
without further opportunities to fix the problem.

warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of
damages. If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement
violates the law of the state applicable to this agreement, the

limitation permitted by the applicable state law. The invalidity or
unenforceability of any provision of this agreement shall not void the
remaining provisions.

additions or deletions to any Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any
Defect you cause.

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at
www.gutenberg.org Section 3. Information about the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

501(c)(3) educational corporation organized under the laws of the
state of Mississippi and granted tax exempt status by the Internal
Revenue Service. The Foundation's EIN or federal tax identification
number is 64-6221541. Contributions to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation are tax deductible to the full extent permitted by

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular
state visit www.gutenberg.org/donate

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works.

Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg-tm concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search
facility: www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
